DO NOT TOUCH FILES UNDER THIS DIRECTORY
UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

Files under this directory are the base essentials for Chrome OS policy.

All policies in these file will be filtered out before combining with
Android policies.

In general,
1. It shouldn't contain any AVC rules.
2. Writing macros here is fine.
3. Put type definitions, or genfs_* definitions which already exist in
