# Note 1: These nodes are labeled at runtime, so 'cros deploy' is
# sufficient when only changing this file, and a full image flash is
# not needed just for testing.
# Note 2: If a genfscon rule is common between both ChromeOS and Android,
# add it to the /policy/base/genfs_contexts file instead of this one.
# Once changed, also run 'seinfo' to verify that the changes make it
# into the filesystem's /etc/selinux/../policy.<N> file is recommended.
