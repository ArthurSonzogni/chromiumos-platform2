// Shared library to track the events triggered during Enterprise Rollback.
// Events are tracked in a file that is preserved through powerwash. This file
// is expected to be created at the beginning of the Rollback process only if
// metrics are enabled. It contains metadata corresponding to the ongoing
// Rollback that survives until the file is removed.
// This library can be used simultaneously from multiple processes. However,
// if there are simultaneous calls to methods that lock the metrics file, it is
// possible that not all events are tracked or reported. If the lock is busy,
// the library does not wait for it to be released. By design, we prefer to
// lose events data than blocking the Rollback process.
