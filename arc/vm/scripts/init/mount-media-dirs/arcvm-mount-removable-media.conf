description    "Mount the removable media directory using mount-passthrough."
author         "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job is started by the Chrome browser.
# Stop the job on 'stopping ui' because media directories will become
# unavailable after that point.
stop on stopping ui or stopping vm_concierge

# Do not allow OOM killer to terminate this job since it will break file
# sharing support (which e.g. our Photos app relies on) until ARCVM restarts.
# TODO(b/164939771): Choose a better OOM score which guarantees the Chrome
# browser process is always terminated before this one.
oom score never

# Set VM size soft limit to 1 GB. See arcvm-mount-myfiles.conf for rationale.
# TODO(b/164936284): Specify a lower limit after improving mount-passthrough.
limit as 1000000000 unlimited
