# /usr/sbin/arc-apply-per-board-config internally calls two scripts,
# generate_camera_profile and /usr/sbin/board_hardware_features, to generate
# 3 files,
# /mnt/stateful_partition/encrypted/var/cache/camera/etc/media_profiles.xml,
# /run/arcvm/host_generated/oem/etc/media_profiles.xml (copy of the first
# one), and /run/arcvm/host_generated/oem/etc/permissions/platform.xml.
#
# /run/chromeos-config: /usr/bin/generate_camera_profile executes
#     /usr/bin/cros_config on some boards and the command reads the directory.
#     MS_REC is required since a squashfs image is mounted somewhere in the
#     tree.
# /mnt/stateful_partition/encrypted/var/cache/camera: generate_camera_profile
#     writes results to the directory.
# /var/cache/camera: generate_camera_profile reads a .json in the directory.
#     Also, arc-apply-per-board-config adds camera.prop to the directory.
# /sys: /usr/sbin/board_hardware_features for some boards reads /sys to
#     detect the board's hardware. /usr/sbin/mosys command which
#     generate_camera_profile script uses on some boards also depends on /sys.
# /run/arcvm/host_generated/oem: Both arc-apply-per-board-config and
#     board_hardware_features write results to the directory.
# /dev/camera-internal(0|1) (DEV_CAMERA_ARGS): Reef's board_hardware_features
#     accesses them for determining if the device supports multi cameras.
# /run/libsegmentation: libsegmentation either use the VPD information stored
#     in /sys/firmware/vpd, or - at first reboot after install - a local
#     temporary directory in /run/libsegmentation.
