description   "Run ureadahead in trace mode for ARC++"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# NOTE: this job is not automatically started on boot-up as it is
#       expected to be started manually as needed e.g. when the
#       android container is started without the pack file for the
#       container. This job should not run while arc-ureadahead.conf
#       is running. The existence of the pack and the user's opt-in
#       status of ARC++ decide if the job runs or not.

stop on arc-booted or stop-arc-instance or stopping ui

# Give ureadahead extra time after SIGTERM to write out the pack file.
kill timeout 30
