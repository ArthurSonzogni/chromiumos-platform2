# Setting this value to 1 will make Android boot with ro.debuggable. This
# should make Android behave *mostly* like an -userdebug image.
#
# A non-comprehensive list of caveats:
# * Anything that detects the build type at compile-time will be unaffected, in
#   particular SELinux rules that are relaxed, or the conditional compilation
#   of some system tools.
# * `adb root` will still be unavailable.
# * `su` will be missing.
# * `strace` won't work.
# * The build type will still be -user.

# The variable is regexp-matched by setup_writable_android_mount.sh. Be careful
# when editing. Setting this value to 1 will make the Android root,
# and images for sdcard etc. filesystems read-write. Note that the images
# themselves need to be in a format that supports being mounted this way (e.g.
# ext4), which is not true of the default format (squashfs).
