# Run this job in parallel with arc_setup_wrapper.sh run_oci hook. The job
# shouldn't be started until 'ureadahead' (which may be in tracing mode)
# is stopped, otherwise ureadahead may corrupt the $PACK file. Depending
# on start-arc-instance ensures that.

# 'never' since terminating this job after it starts can cause ARC boot failure.
