description   "Tune sysctls for ARC++"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# vm.min_filelist_kbytes controls how much of the file cache in RAM is
# protected (i.e. not allowed to be evicted).  If too few code pages are kept,
# the system can thrash.  Android apps add pressure to the cache, so we protect
# more pages when ARC++ is running.
#
# See crbug.com/709660 for discussion.
