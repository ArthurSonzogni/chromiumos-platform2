# TODO(crbug.com/1184906): This file should be deleted and the OWNERS
# includes changed to refer directly to the chromium/src version once the
# the branch names between chromium/src and chromiumos/platform2 match
# again.
#
# For now, this is a copy of chromium/src/components/arc/session/OWNERS
# and must be kept in sync.
