author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# The metrics daemon is responsible for receiving and forwarding to
# chrome UMA statistics not produced by chrome.

# Wait for the crash reporter to check whether the previous session
# ended abnormally.

# Make the metrics daemon killable, because if it has a leak it's better to
# restart it than to OOM-panic.
oom score 0
# Let the daemon crash if it grows too much.  "as" is "address space" (vm
# size).  We expect a typical VM size of about 30MB for the daemon.

# Minijail flags
# -G    Inherit supplementary groups from user metrics to have debugfs access.
# -l    Enter a new IPC namespace.
# -n    Set no_new_privs.
# -e    Enter a new network namespace
# --uts    Enter a new UTS namespace.
# -r    Remount /proc read only.
# -v    Enter a new mount namespace.
# -T static    Tells Minijail metrics is a static binary, locksdown pre-exec
# --profile=minimalistic-mountns    Setup a mount namespace with some
#                                   basic mountpoints.
# -b /dev    (Read only) Needed by rootdev to read and determine
#             containing device, block.
# -k /run    Create /run in tmpfs to mount subdirectories required by metrics.
# -b /run/dbus    (Read only) Required by metrics for dbus.
# -b /run/metrics    (Read/ Write) Required by metrics for reading flags from
#                     other services, e.g. crash reporter, hammer, crouton.
# -b /run/systemd/journal    (Read only) Required by metrics for logging data.
# -b /sys    (Read only) Required by rootdev to read device/block metadata.
# -b /sys/kernel/debug/ (Read only) Required by metrics for GPU frequency info.
# -k /var    Create /var in tmpfs to mount its subdirectories.
# -b /var/lib/metrics    (Read/Write) Metrics stores persistent data files.
#                        which then are read for writing to metrics/uma-events.
# -b /var/log/vmlog    (Read/Write) Metrics logs crash/error or any other
#                      daemon related messages in log/vmlogs.
