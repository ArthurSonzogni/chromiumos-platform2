  Instead of creating a new instance of UserActivityController, use the
  existing instance so it tracks the Lacros instance correctly. Wait for
  the Lacros window to be open and visible so it appears in the MRU
  window tracker used internally by UserActivityManager to decide whether
  to query Lacros for web page state.
