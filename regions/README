This folder contains ChromeOS region database.

The database is created in JSON format and availalbe in
 /usr/share/misc/cros-regions.json.

Every ChromeOS device should have a "region" VPD entry that can be directly
used as a key in JSON database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For projects that need to use unpublished regions, please:

1. Create a virtual/chromeos-regions package in board private overlay.
2. In the package, set RDEPEND="chromeos-base/regions-private"
3. Build system and try. You can use tool 'cros_region_data' to verify:
    cros_region_data <FIELD> <REGION_TO_TEST>
   For example, "cros_region_data description us" gives you "United States".
