start on started system-services

# Minijail forks off the desired process.

# If the job respawns 10 times in 10 seconds, stop trying.

# resourced handles low memory situations and shall not be OOM-killed.
oom score never

# Let the daemon crash if it grows too much. "as" is "address space" (VM
# size). The typical VM size of resourced is about 14MB. Set the limit to
# about 3x typical VM size.
limit as 45000000 unlimited

# Comments to the args in order:
# -i: Exit immediately after fork. The jailed process will run in the
#     background.
# --uts: Create and enter new UTS namespace (hostname/NIS domain name).
# -N: Create and enter new cgroup namespace.
# -p: Create and enter new PID namespace.
# --profile minimalistic-mountns: Use the minimal mountns profile to start.
#
# Mounts:
# - Need write access to /proc/pressure
# - Get a writeable and empty /run tmpfs path.
# - Need read access to /run/dbus for DBus communications.
# - Need read access to /run/chromeos-config for reading configuration.
# - Get a writeable and empty /sys tmpfs path.
# - Need read access to /sys/kernel/mm/chromeos-low_mem for checking memory
#   configs.
# - Need write access to energy_performance_preference sysfs entries.
# - Need read access to power_supply sysfs entries.
# - Need read access to devices to follow power_supply symlinks.
# - Need write access to gpu sysfs entries.
# - Need write access to /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset sysfs entries.
#
# -u: Run as resourced user and group.
# -g: Run as resourced group.
# -G: Inherit supplementary groups from user resourced.
# -c: Add capabilities CAP_SYS_RESOURCE (only the effective capability mask
#     will be considered by minijail0).
# -n: No new privileges (no_new_privs).
# -S: Use the resourced seccomp policy.
# --: Separator followed by the command.
#
# NOTE: We don't add "-e" since we want to receive udev events.
