author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

start on started system-services
stop on stopping system-services

# Minijail forks off the desired process.
expect fork

# If the job respawns 10 times in 10 seconds, stop trying.

# resourced handles low memory situations and shall not be OOM-killed.
oom score never

# Let the daemon crash if it grows too much. "as" is "address space" (VM
# size). The typical VM size of resourced is about 3MB. Set the limit to
# 5x typical VM size.
limit as 15000000 unlimited

# Comments to the args in order:
# - Exit immediately after fork. The jailed process will run in the background.
# - Create and enter new UTS namespace (hostname/NIS domain name).
# - Create and enter new cgroup namespace.
# - Create and enter new PID namespace.
# - Use the minimal mountns profile to start.
# - Get a writeable and empty /run tmpfs path.
# - Need access to /run/dbus for DBus communications.
# - Need access to /run/chromeos-config for reading configuration.
# - Get a writeable and empty /sys tmpfs path.
# - Need access to /sys/kernel/mm/chromeos-low_mem for checking memory configs.
# - Need write access to energy_performance_preference sysfs entries.
# - Need read access to power_supply sysfs entries.
# - Need read access to devices to follow power_supply symlinks.
# - Need write access to gpu sysfs entries.
# - Need write access to /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset sysfs entries.
# - Run as resourced user and group.
# - Inherit supplementary groups from user resourced.
# - Grant no caps.
# - No new privileges (no_new_privs).
# - Use the resourced seccomp policy.
# - Execute the daemon.
#
# NOTE: We don't add "-e" since we want to receive udev events.
