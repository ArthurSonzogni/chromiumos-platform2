  # Create a folder on encstateful where krb5_machine.keytab and config.dat are
  # going to live. The group x access is required by the authpolicyd-exec user
  # to access the keytab. config.dat is a private file of authpolicyd. All other
  # files are written to /tmp which is created fresh for each authpolicyd
  # invocation. (see -t option).

# Minijail actually forks off the desired process.
expect fork

# -i makes sure minijail0 exits right away and won't block upstart.
# -p creates PID namespace (process won't see any other processes).
# -l creates IPC namespace (isolates System V IPC objects/POSIX message queues).
# -r remounts /proc read-only (prevents any messing with it).
# -v enters new mount namespace, allows to change mounts inside jail.
# -t creates new, empty tmp directory (technically, mounts tmpfs).
# -n prevents that execve gains privileges, required for seccomp filters.
# -c 180 sets the CAP_SETPCAP and CAP_SETUID capabilities to drop capabilities
#    from the bounding set resp. to change user (we switch to authpolicyd-exec
#    internally when running Samba code or parsing data).
# -P creates a pivot_root at the target folder.
# -b /,/ mounts dev/root read-only.
# -b /run,/run and -b /var,/var mount read-only, required for D-Bus.
# -b /dev,/dev and -b /sys,/sys are required for net ads join to work.
# -b /var/lib/authpolicyd,/tmp/var_lib_authpolicyd,1 mounts read-write to store
#    authpolicyd state.
# -b /var/lib/metrics,/var/lib/metrics,1 mounts read-write to store UMA metrics.
# -u authpolicyd changes user.
# -g authpolicyd changes group.
# -G inherit authpolicyd's supplementary groups (in particular 'policy-readers')
# -e is not specified because the service needs to connect to an AD server to
#    join a domain, authenticate users and fetch user and device policies.
