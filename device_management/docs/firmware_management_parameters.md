# Firmware Management Parameters

Device Management manages a TPM space which holds management parameters for the
firmware.

## Overview

Firmware Management Parameters (FWMP) control the rewritable (RW) firmware boot
process. They can be used to disable developer mode on enterprise devices. If
developer mode is enabled, they can limit which kernel key can be used to sign
developer images, and/or enable developer features such as booting from USB or
legacy OS.

The FWMP is stored in a TPM NVRAM space. The space is logically defined as
follows:

```c
struct FirmwareManagementParametersRawV1_0 {
  uint8_t crc;
  uint8_t struct_size;
  uint8_t struct_version;
  uint8_t reserved0;
  uint32_t flags;
  uint8_t developer_key_hash[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];
} __attribute__((packed));
```

The `crc` is a `CRC8` over the `struct_version`...hash fields.

The `struct_size` is the size of the entire structure in bytes.

The `struct_version` contains the major version in the high nibble and the minor
version in the low nibble. Current structure is version 0x10 = 1.0. Minor
version changes are backwards-compatible; a 1.0 reader can parse any 1.x data,
though there may be new fields following hash[]. Major version changes are not
backwards-compatible; a 1.0 reader cannot parse any 2.x data.

The `reserved0` field is written 0 by current writers and ignored by current
readers. It is for padding the flags to a 32-bit boundary. Future 1.x versions
of the struct may use it.

The flags field contains several bitflags. Unused flags bits are set to 0 by
current writers.

```c
DEVELOPER_DISABLE_BOOT = 1;
DEVELOPER_DISABLE_RECOVERY_INSTALL = 2;
DEVELOPER_DISABLE_RECOVERY_ROOTFS = 4;
DEVELOPER_ENABLE_USB = 8;
DEVELOPER_ENABLE_LEGACY = 16;
DEVELOPER_USE_KEY_HASH = 32;
DEVELOPER_DISABLE_CASE_CLOSED_DEBUGGING_UNLOCK = 64;
```

The `developer_key_hash` is a SHA-256 hash of the developer key data
(vb2_packed_key.key_size bytes at offset vb2_packed_key.key_offset from the
start of a vb2_packed_key).

Once the struct is filled, it is written to the NVRAM space. A subsequent 0 byte
write locks the NVRAM space (bWriteDefine) from future modification without
redefinition using the TPM Owner passphrase or by asserting physical presence.

- See `device_management/dbus_bindings/org.chromium.DeviceManagement.xml` for the
exact D-Bus API calls. See `firmware_management_parameters.h` for more information.
- See `src/platform/vboot_reference/` for the firmware implementation. Note that the
contents of the space and the NVRAM index must be consistent with
`src/platform/vboot_reference/firmware/lib/include/rollback_index.h`

## Device Integration

FWMP is an optional space. If it is not present, the firmware behaves in a
default manner, as if FWMP were present with flags=0.

On a fresh installation, enterprise enrollment or a developer may create a FWMP
while the TPM owner password is still known:

```bash
device_management_client --action=set_firmware_management_parameters \
  --flags=XXX [--developer_key_hash=YYY]
```

Where `XXX` is the flags as a 32-bit value, and `YYY` is the optional SHA-256
developer key hash digest as a 64-character hexadecimal string.

If the device is de-enrolled, or a developer wants to remove a FWMP they
previously created:

```bash
device_management_client --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters
```

Note that still requires the TPM owner password to be known, or the TPM owner to
have been reset by toggling developer mode off and back on using the firmware or
by issuing:

```bash
crossystem clear_tpm_owner_request=1
```

and then rebooting.

On subsequent boots, the TPM owner password is no longer known, preventing the
space from being reset or removed. The current settings can still be read back
via:

```bash
device_management_client --action=get_firmware_management_parameters
```

## NVRAM Index Selection

The NVRAM space index 0x100A was picked to follow the other spaces used by the
firmware (0x1007 - 0x1009).
