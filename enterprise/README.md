# Enterprise

Enterprise service is aimed for providing access service to HWSEC-related platform features e.g. firmware management parameters, install_attributes etc.

Firmware Management Parameters control the rewritable boot process. They can be used to disable developer mode on enterprise devices.

Install Attributes represents a set of name-value pairs representing data about device ownership.
