description   "Run the shill network connection manager"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# shill termination may take more than 5s (the default kill timeout) in some
# cases (e.g. it needs to disconnect a cellular modem from the network). A
# longer kill timeout is used to ensure that shill terminates properly in most
# cases. Also, stop shill on "starting pre-shutdown" so its exiting blocks the
# chromeos_shutdown script from running (jobs that "stop on stopping
# boot-services" may still be running in parallel with chromeos_shutdown if
# they do not exit quickly).
