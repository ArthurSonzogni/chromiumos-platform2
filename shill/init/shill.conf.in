description   "Run the shill network connection manager"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# shill termination may take more than 5s (the default kill timeout) in some
# cases (e.g. it needs to disconnect a cellular modem from the network). A
# longer kill timeout is used to ensure that shill terminates properly in most
# cases. Also, stop shill on "starting pre-shutdown" so its exiting blocks the
# chromeos_shutdown script from running (jobs that "stop on stopping
# boot-services" may still be running in parallel with chromeos_shutdown if
# they do not exit quickly).

# Let the daemon crash if it grows too much.  "as" is "address space" (vm size).
# Each extra thread (i.e., except for the main one) may take 8MB (stack) + 64MB
# (malloc arena) and currently shill may have 4 extra threads at most, so set
# the value to ~500MB here. Note that the shill code we care about here is
# single-threaded, but the libs that shill is using may start some threads by
# themselves (e.g., libbase, libchaps). Also see b/268424208.
