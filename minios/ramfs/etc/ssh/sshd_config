# TODO(b/296125036) Support clients which require ssh-rsa.
# Some ssh clients do not support stronger non-SHA1-based schemes, so we
# have to allow ssh-rsa to avoid breaking some of the labs and testing
# infrastructure. Once those are moved over to ssh clients that support
# schemes like rsa-sha2-256 or stronger.
