description     "dumps VPD information for chrome://system"
author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# VPD (Vital Product Data) information is shown on chrome://system for
# user, feedback, and partner's customer service center.
#
# This script will read VPD from BIOS and dump into /var/log/vpd_2.0.txt.
# It should be executed at least once some time after boot and before user
# types "chrome://system" in chrome location bar.
#
# Since VPD utility could invoke flashrom utility to access BIOS, which is
# slow, this script should be run after calculating boot time.
# Hence, later than boot-complete can be acceptable.

  # Since we don't change the VPD data too often, only create the log file
  # if it does not exist.
