description     "Enables power on after power failure for DUT's in the lab"
author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# For test images being ran on Intel-based devices in the lab, set the
# correct pci bit so that it will reboot on a power cycle.

# NOTE - This job may run more than once per boot, because the .labmachine
# image is missing on the first boot after the autotest try job process
# completes. Therefore the autotest installation process will rerun this job a
# second time on that boot.
