# user it's running as
export USERHELPER_UID=${USER_ID}

# launch 'dbus-daemon --session' as chronos and export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
# variable for ibus-daemon. this is necessary since ibus-daemon accesses the
# D-Bus session bus to retrieve user preferences on GConf2 repository and
# our D-Bus package doesn't support auto-launching the daemon.
# TODO(yusukes): remove this hack once we remove the GConf dependency from IBus.
