Developer Console

To return to the browser, press:

  [ Ctrl ] and [ Alt ] and [ F1 ]

To use this console, the developer mode switch must be engaged.
Doing so will destroy any saved data on the system.

In developer mode, it is possible to
- login and sudo as user 'chronos'
- require a password for sudo and login(*)
- disable power management behavior (screen dimming):
  sudo initctl stop powerd
- install your own operating system image!

* To set a password for 'chronos', run the following as root:

echo "chronos:$(openssl passwd -1)" > /mnt/stateful_partition/etc/devmode.passwd


Have fun and send patches!
