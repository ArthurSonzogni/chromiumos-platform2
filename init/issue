Developer Console

To return to the browser, press:

  [ Ctrl ] and [ Alt ] and [ F1 ]

To use this console, the developer mode switch must be engaged.
Doing so will destroy any saved data on the system.

In developer mode, it is possible to
- login and sudo as user 'chronos'
- disable logins in this console by running:
  sudo touch /mnt/stateful_partition/etc/nologin
- disable sudo by running:
  sudo touch /mnt/stateful_partition/etc/nosudo
- disable power management behavior (screen dimming):
  sudo initctl stop powerd
- install your own operating system image!

Have fun and send patches!
