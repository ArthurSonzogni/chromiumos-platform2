# The SafeSetID LSM uses this list to record which UID’s/GID’s to restrict, look
# here for more information:
# https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/LSM/SafeSetID.html

# The entries below are formatted as UID1:UID2, meaning:
# "a process with UID1 is allowed to change its UID to UID2"

# This file contains the config for uids which do not belong to any specific
# projects.

# Only allow "nobody" to transition to allowed users.
