# Relabel debugfs separately from chromeos_startup. Labeling debugfs is compute
# intensive, and debugfs should not be critical to many early services, and so
# is moved out of the critical path of boot.
# NB: We block 'boot-services', because some services in the 'network-services'
# and 'system-services' phases touch debugfs.

# Other jobs that depend on this job need to wait until this job completes

# /sys/kernel/debug/tracing is an automount of tracefs, which gets relabeled
# elsewhere. We exclude its contents to save time, but we relabel the mount
# point for consistency, in case the automount never gets
# mounted (e.g., by statx(2) without AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT).
