# Start after startup, when /var/ is mounted.
# This will be before crash_reporter starts because `stopping` is a hook,
# meaning that "the emitter waits for it to complete before carrying on", per
# http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#hooks.
# crash_reporter has `start on starting boot-services`, so it will start just
# before boot_services. boot_services, in turn, `starts on stopped startup`.
