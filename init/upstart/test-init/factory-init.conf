description    "Initialize factory test environment"

# For factory test to perform early initialization Ex: changing UI start
# parameters, disable or add upstart jobs...
# Hint: ui.conf starts on "started boot-services", so this factory-init should
# always run before UI starts.

# This service should be started explicitly by an earlier service loading
# factory_utils.sh and checking is_factory_mode, for example cros-payloads.conf.
# Other factory related service can do "start on started factory-init" to
# prevent checking is_factory_mode.
