# The ui job post-stop script depends on a variety of daemons to be
# up and running during shutdown.  In general, those daemons run
# from jobs that use 'stop on stopping boot-services'.  In general,
# if a job says 'stop on stopping fubar', the job's 'post-stop'
# script runs *after* the the main process for 'fubar' is already
# dead.  So, to guarantee correct operation, the 'ui' job can't use
# 'stop on stopping boot-services'.
#
# We use this job to delay 'stopping boot-services' until after the
# 'ui' job cleans up.  The basic operation is this:
#   + The 'ui' job stop conditions prevent this job's 'started'
#     event until the 'post-stop' script completes.
#   + This job stops itself with its own 'started' event.
#   + The 'stopping boot-services' event doesn't happen until
#     all of the preceding steps complete.

start on starting halt or starting reboot
stop on started pre-shutdown

# Log that we're shutting down and why we're doing it before rsyslogd stops.
#
# If SHUTDOWN_REASON is unset, the request didn't come from powerd. This
# typically means that someone or something called
# shutdown/halt/poweroff/reboot/etc. directly.
