# Start alongside chromeos_startup.
# Unless boot-splash has already query CBX level, at first reboot after update,
# will query gsctool and seed /run/libsegmenation cache for boards that can
# support CBX.
# For subsequent boot, the tool just read the VPD and confirms the data is
# valid.
# For boards that do not support CBX, this is mostly a noop operation.
