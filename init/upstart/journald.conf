pre-start script
  # File mode includes group write permission to allow rsyslogd to create its
  # socket. The directory group is root; syslog starts as root, and only after
  # initialization switches to the syslog user.

# Upstart has limitation on how it can track daemon readiness.  See this report
# for more details: https://crbug.com/702794#27. net_poll_tool allows us to
# emit the started event only after the socket is ready.
# /run/systemd/journal/socket is the last socket created by journald.
#
# We don't use --mount-dev because of the way the /dev/log unix socket works.
# See https://crbug.com/764455#c6 for details.
#
# We don't use a pid namespace because it breaks journald's ability to log the
# remote pid.
#
# CAP_SYS_PTRACE is required to read /proc/<PID>/exe.
# We aren't going to give that capability to journald due to security concerns.
