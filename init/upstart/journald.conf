# Upstart has limitation on how it can track daemon readiness.  See this report
# for more details: https://crbug.com/702794#27. net_poll_tool allows us to
# emit the started event only after the socket is ready.
# /run/systemd/journal/socket is the last socket created by journald.

# CAP_SYS_PTRACE is required to read /proc/<PID>/exe.
# We aren't going to give that capability to journald due to security concerns.
