description   "Record that system boot is complete"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job is the official timestamp for boot time measurement.  It
# needs to run separately before 'system-services' because the amount
# of work that starts with 'system-services' could otherwise delay the
# 'bootstat' timestamp and make boot time measurements less reliable.
