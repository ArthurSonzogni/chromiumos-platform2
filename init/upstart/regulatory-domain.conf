# The list of regulatory domains which we must apply in order to constrain
# the system to a more restrictive behavior than our world regulatory domain.
# The system can only be set to one regulatory domain at a time.  As well,
# any given system should have only one "region" value.  However, in order
# to hedge against any strange cases, this value should be in decreasing
# order of constraints, so the system will attain the most constrained
# domain.
