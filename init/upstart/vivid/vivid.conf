# We use vivid, which emulates video4linux hardwares, to run camera tests on VM
# boards.
# By loading vivid in upstart, each test doesn't have to care whether a DUT is a
# VM or not.
#
# The following script loads vivid as a video capture device if the DUT is QEMU
# or GCE.
# |n_devs| in the module parameter is the number of instances to create.
# "0x101" for |node_types| represents a video capture device and a video output
# device.
# TODO(b:235025532): Currently a check in vivid-core.c prevents creating only
# the video capture device without an output device.
