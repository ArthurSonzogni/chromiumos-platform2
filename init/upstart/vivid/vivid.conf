# We use vivid, which emulates video4linux hardwares, to run camera tests on VM
# boards.
# By loading vivid in upstart, each test doesn't have to care whether a DUT is a
# VM or not.
#
# The following script loads vivid as a video capture device if the DUT is QEMU.
# |n_devs| in the module parameter is the number of instances to create.
# "0x1" for |node_types| represents a video capture device.

    modprobe vivid n_devs=1 node_types=0x1
