# This job depends on two other jobs: 1) cgroups.conf that creates
# session_manager_containers/ and 2) ui.conf that creates ui/. Because of the
# dependency, this job uses 'start on started ui' to wait for ui.conf's
# pre-start script to finish. This job doesn't have to wait for cgroups.conf
# because ui.conf already does that. 'on started boot-services' is also added
# to prevent the job from being started again on logout. The job should run
# only once shortly after device boot.
