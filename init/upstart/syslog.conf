# The way upstart tracks daemon readiness is not the way we need it to.  In the
# normal forking/daemon mode (no -n), rsyslog will fork and then wait for the
# child to prepare /dev/log before exiting.  However, upstart will see the first
# fork and mark the service started immediately and not wait for rsyslog itself
# to exit.  That creates a small window where other services may start and try
# to use syslog which would fail.  That's why we don't bother using daemon mode
# (we pass -n), and why we need the poll command below.
# See this report for more details: https://crbug.com/702794#27

# See above comment for why we need to poll ourselves.
#
# The timeout is high, but it should never be hit unless there's a serious
# problem, in which case we want to fall over anyways.  We can't set it too
# low because we also run in slow environments like VMs.
