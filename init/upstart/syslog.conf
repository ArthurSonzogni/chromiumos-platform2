# We don't use --mount-dev because of the way the /dev/log unix socket works.
# See https://crbug.com/764455#c6 for details.
#
# rsyslogd creates it's unix domain socket at /run/systemd/journal/syslog.
# Journald forwards messages to that address.
#
# We don't use a pid namespace because that breaks syslog's ability to log the
# remote pid.  Otherwise the logs would look like (where [0] is the pid):
# INFO sshd[0]: ...
