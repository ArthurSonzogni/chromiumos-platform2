# HEADS UP!  'expect fork' is usually a loser when used with
# 'script'.  Unfortunately, shill needs 'expect fork', and
# we need a script to figure out command arguments at run time.
#
# To avoid confusing Upstart, the script below can use only shell
# built-in operations until it gets to the 'exec' at the end.  Any
# command that causes the shell to fork/exec a subprocess is a
# no-no.
