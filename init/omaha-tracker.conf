# as the script /usr/sbin/omaha_tracker.sh only has executable content on
# Google Chrome OS builds, this job is a no-op on chromium OS builds.

# start-user-session is only emitted from the new session_manager code.
# chromeos-xsession (the old way of starting the WM) is not run on that
# code pathway.
start on start-user-session
stop on stopping ui

# sadly, these can't reference each other.
