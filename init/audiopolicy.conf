# This job maintains information about the A/V hardware which is
# presented to the OS.
#
# It communicates with Chromium, the browser, to provide information
# about the devices present and their Alsa controls.
#
# It is the responsibility of clients, such as Chromium, of this
# daemon to provide output to, or gather input from, the desired
# device.  With the exception of multiplexing output between the
# internal speakers & headphone jack, and the internal microphone and
# the microphone jack, this daemon does not provide input & output
# policy.
#
# [TBD] This daemon also initializes the sound system to 'factory defaults'
#       upon start, stop and HUP.
