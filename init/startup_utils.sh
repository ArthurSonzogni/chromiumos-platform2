# Create, possibly migrate from, the unencrypted stateful partition, and bind
# mount the /var and /home/chronos mounts from the encrypted filesystem
# /mnt/stateful_partition/encrypted, all managed by the "mount-encrypted"
# helper. Takes the same arguments as mount-encrypted. Since /var is managed by
# mount-encrypted, it should not be created in the unencrypted stateful
# partition. Its mount point in the root filesystem exists already from the
# rootfs image.  Since /home is still mounted from the unencrypted stateful
# partition, having /home/chronos already doesn't matter. It will be created by
# mount-encrypted if it is missing. These mounts inherit nodev,noexec,nosuid
# from the encrypted filesystem /mnt/stateful_partition/encrypted.
