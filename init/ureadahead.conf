# Start ureadahead as early as possible. Note that it depends on some of the
# operations in chromeos_startup. Notably, it requires /var to be mounted,
# because the pack file is located in /var/lib/ureadahead, and ureadahead
# tracing requires /sys/kernel/debug be mounted.

stop on starting boot-complete

# Give ureadahead extra time after SIGTERM to write out the pack file.
