description     "Start the failsafe timer"
author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job is used as the guarantee that the "failsafe" job will start.
# It's a separate job to allow failsafe to start on normal conditions
# before the timer here expires.
#
# NOTE: We purposely don't start the delay until boot-services
# have finished starting up so that people waiting on failsafe
# can always assume that boot-services are there.
