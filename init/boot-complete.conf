description   "Send boot stats after login prompt is visible"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This script is primarily responsible for sending boot time statistics
# after we finish booting.  Note that many other jobs also start on
# "stopped boot-complete", though.

# Note, this line is modified by chromeos-factoryinstall.ebuild
# and mod_for_factory. Please do not change without also changing
# those references.

  # The login-prompt-visible signal is emitted every time the login
  # screen is displayed.  The check below makes sure boot stats are
  # reported only once per boot.

  # If ureadahead is still running, then presumably it's performing
  # a boot trace.  We only care about tracing until login prompt, so
  # stop the process now.

  # We have to ignore the return status in case ureadahead has
  # already completed, because pkill helpfully exits with a non-zero
  # status when no process was found.
