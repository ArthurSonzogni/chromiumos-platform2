  # The following ensures that there is a valid machine-id for dbus.  Just
  # running dbus-uuidgen --ensure is not enough if there is an invalid
  # machine-id.  For instance if machine-id is not a 33 byte file
  # dbus-uuidgen will fail without regenerating a UUID.  The operation of
  # generating a new UUID takes 4ms on CortexA9, so the boot performance
  # impact is minimal.
