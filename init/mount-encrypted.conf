description   "Chrome OS post-mount-encrypted cleanup"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job handles delayed copying of the mount-encrypted log file into
# /var/log. Since mount-encrypted forks a filesystem resizing process
# into the background, give it a chance to at least start running before
# copying the log. Waiting until after system-services seems sufficient,
# and additionally does not add any delay to chromeos_startup itself.

script
  # Copy the log (not through symlinks), and retain permissions. The
  # target should always be removed since the log is only useful on a
  # per-boot basis, and we don't want to follow symlinks on the target
  # either, and use a trailing slash to require that "log" is a directory.
  cp -aP --remove-destination /tmp/mount-encrypted.log /var/log/ || true
