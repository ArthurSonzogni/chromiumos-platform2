# If this file return 0, we use the new interface. Otherwise, it'll return
# 1 to denote that the old interface will be used. If any other return code
# is returned, then use the old interface.

# If the configuration file in stateful partition doesn't exist or is not
# conformant to the syntax, then we'll look at the one in /etc for default.

# We ignore any line that starts with #, then we look for key value pair in
# the syntax of "key=value" (Note that there's no space). Then, we look at
# the value corresponding to the key "USER_DATA_AUTH_INTERFACE", if it's "on"
# then we'll use the new interface, if it's "off", we'll use the old one.
# Line(s) after the first line, if any, is ignored.
