description   "Chrome OS post-mount-encrypted cleanup"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job handles delayed copying of the mount-encrypted log file into
# /var/log. Since mount-encrypted forks a filesystem resizing process
# into the background, give it a chance to at least start running before
# copying the log. Waiting until after system-services seems sufficient,
# and additionally does not add any delay to chromeos_startup itself.

  # Copy the log (not through symlinks), and retain permissions but use
  # the default SELinux label for the target. The target should always
  # be removed since we don't want to follow symlinks on the target.
  # Use a trailing slash to require that "log" is a directory.
  cp -aPZ --remove-destination /tmp/mount-encrypted.log /var/log/ || true

  # Dump the log in syslog to preserve mount-encrypted info over reboots.
