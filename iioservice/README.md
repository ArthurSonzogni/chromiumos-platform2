# Chrome OS Iio Service

The repository hosts the core Chrome OS platform iioservice components,
including:

- Mojo IPC library for clients to connect to iioservice
- [Iioservice test executable](iioservice_test) for Iio Service IPC

## Mojo IPC library

This library provides mojo interfaces and SensorServerDbus and SensorClientDbus
to help iioservice and sensor clients bootstrap Mojo connection and connect to
SensorHalDispatcher in Chromium.

## Daemon iioservice

- `/usr/sbin/iioservice`

This daemon provides mojo channels that let processes connect to it. iioservice
will dispatch devices' event data to the processes that need them. Each process
can set the desired frequencies and IIO channels of devices without conflicts,
as it owns all IIO devices.
