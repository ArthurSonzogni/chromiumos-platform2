description     "Replay input devices (accel) udev events needed by Chrome"
author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job is used to replay events of devices needed by Chrome,
# in particular accelerometers.
# Given accelerometer needs VPD data, and on some kernel, VPD data is cached
# in the stateful partition, this job has to start after boot-service.
#
# Subsystems listed here must be excluded from udev-trigger.conf to avoid
# replaying twice.

# script must run otherwise device will never go in tablet mode/rotate.
oom score never

start on started boot-services
stop on stopping boot-services

  # Use sysname-match to trigger the platform and chromeos devices.
