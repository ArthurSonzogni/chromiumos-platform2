This is a collection of ML based functionality used within ChromeOS. It has
been put together initially to support the Video Conferencing features
(Background Blur, Portrait Relighting), and acts as the interface to the
Google3 ML code brought in via `libcros_ml_core_internal.so`.

More details can be found at go/cros-videoconf-ml-infra.
