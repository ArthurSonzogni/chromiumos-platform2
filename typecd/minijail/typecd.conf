# - Exit immediately after fork. The jailed process will run in the background.
# - Create and enter new UTS namespace (hostname/NIS domain name).
# - Create and enter new cgroup namespace.
# - Create and enter new PID namespace.
# - Use the minimal mountns profile to start.
# - Get a writeable and empty /run tmpfs path.
# - Mount D-Bus.
# - Mount /run/udev so that we can receive udev monitor events.
# - Mount the chromeos-config path so we can get system config information.
# - Get a writeable and empty /sys tmpfs path.
# - Mount the /sys/class directory required by typecd.
# - Mount the /sys/bus/usb directory required by typecd.
# - Mount the /sys/devices directory required by typecd.
# - Get a writeable and empty /var tmpfs path.
# - Mount the /var/lib/metrics path equired by UMA metrics reporting.
# - Run as typecd user and group.
# - Inherit supplementary groups from from user typecd.
# - Grant no caps.
# - No new privileges (no_new_privs).
