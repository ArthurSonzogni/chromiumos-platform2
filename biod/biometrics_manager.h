// are supported: 1) enrolling new record objects, 2) authenticating against
// those record objects, and 3) destroying all record objects made from this
// BiometricsManager. For DestroyAllRecords the operation is as simple as
// calling the function. For the other operations, the BiometricsManager object
// must be entered into AuthSession or EnrollSession, which is represented
// in code by the return of the session objects. EnrollSession and AuthSession
// can be thought of as session objects that are ongoing as long as the unique
// pointers remain in scope and the End/Cancel methods haven't been called. It's
// undefined what StartEnrollSession or StartAuthSession will do if there is an
// valid outstanding EnrollSession or AuthSession object in the wild.
