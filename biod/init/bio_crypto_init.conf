# This job blocks the boot process in boot-services until all parts of this
# job/task are complete. This is important for the following two reasons:
# 1. For security purposes, we want to ensure that the secret seed is
#    transferred and cleared before other major processes are running.
# 2. We want to ensure that this process does not conflict with the firmware
#    in boot-update-firmware, which cannot have a direct dependence on this
#    upstart job.

# Here (in order) are a list of the args added:
# - Create and enter new UTS namespace (hostname/NIS domain name).
# - Create and enter new network namespace.
# - Create and enter new IPC namespace.
# - Create and enter new cgroup namespace.
# - Create and enter new PID namespace.
# - Same options as minimalistic-mountns except we do not mount /dev/log because
#   it doesn't necessarily exist since the logging daemon hasn't started yet.
# - Get a writeable and empty /run tmpfs path.
# - Mount the /run/biod_seed file.
# - Get a writeable and empty /var tmpfs path.
# - Mount the log directory in it.
# - Mount the FPMCU dev node.
# - Run as biod user and group.
# - Inherit supplementary groups from from user biod.
# - Grant no caps.
# - No new privileges (no_new_privs).
# - Use bio_crypto_init seccomp policy.
# - Execute the binary.
