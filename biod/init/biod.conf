# Here (in order) are a list of the args added:
# - Set mount namespace to be a slave mount.
# - Set up a new VFS namespace (although this should be covered by
#   minimalistic-mountns, leaving this out yields the following error:
#   "Can't skip marking mounts as MS_PRIVATE without mount namespaces.")
# - Use the minimal mountns profile to start.
# - Get a writeable and empty /run tmpfs path.
# - Mount dbus and daemonstore on it.
# - Get a writeable and empty /var tmpfs path.
# - Mount the log directory in it.
# - Mount the metrics directory.
# - Mount the FPMCU dev node.
# - Run as biod user and group.
# - Inherit supplementary groups from from user biod.
# - Grant no caps.
# - Execute the daemon.
# - Add the log dir.
# - Pipe output to biod.out.
