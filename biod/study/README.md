# Fingerprint Study Tools

This directory holds many tools that pertain to fingerprint system evaluation.

## VSCode Python Completion

1.  Run `python-venv-setup.sh` to create the Python virtual environment.
2.  Open the platform2/biod directory in VS Code. You must explicitly open this
    directory for the [`biod/pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) to
    automatically configure VS Code for Python.

## Terminal/Shell Python Setup

1.  Run `python-venv-setup.sh`, as mentioned above.
2.  Run `. sourceme.bash` from any terminal that you will be developing with, to
    activate the Python3 virtual environment. This will need to be rerun in
    every new terminal/shell.
