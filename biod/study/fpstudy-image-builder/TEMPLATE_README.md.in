The image `@IMAGE@` was generated using the `build.sh` script on @DATE_SEC@.

# Setup Instructions

## Requirements

*   A Chromebook that is capable of going into Developer Mode. The device owner
    must have applied a policy where `DeviceBlockDevMode` is false. This might
    mean that the device owner needs to login to apply this policy.
*   A [SuzyQ CCD cable][CCD Cable].
*   This requires a USB flash drive of at least 16GB. These instructions will
    destroy all data on the flash drive, so please backup all data beforehand.
*   A GNU/Linux machine that has access to USB.

## 1. Check File Integrity

Please run `md5sum -c checksum.md5` in this directory to verify the integrity of
all files. All files should be marked at **OK**. If any file is marked as
**FAILED**, please try downloading the archive and extracting again.

## 2. Prepare Chrome OS USB Install Media

We will use a GNU/Linux machine to setup a USB flash drive as Chrome OS install
media.

1.  Plug the USB flash drive into the GNU/Linux machine.
2.  Use `sudo dmesg` or a similar utility to determine the flash drive's name,
    like `/dev/sda` or `/dev/sdb`, without the partition number. We will refer
    to the flash drive as `/dev/sdX` in the following steps.
3.  Flash the `@IMAGE@` image to a USB flash drive using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo umount /dev/sdX*
    sudo dd if=@IMAGE@ bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync of=/dev/sdX
    sudo sync
    ```

4.  Remove the flash drive from the GNU/Linux machine

## 3. Setup New Chromebook With Fingerprint Study Image

### A. Place Chromebook into Developer Mode

See
[https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/device/developer-mode/](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/device/developer-mode/).

For most modern Chromebooks this requires the following:

1.  Pressing `Esc` + `↻` + `Power` (Esc-"Refresh"-Power) to get into recovery
    mode.
2.  Press `Ctrl` + `d` followed by `Enter` to enter developer mode.
3.  Your device will reboot.
4.  If you only see one option saying `Confirm returning to secure mode`, then
    Dev Mode is blocked by the device owner. If this is a Google provided
    device, it will need to be returned to Google to unlock.

    Have your Google contact look at
    [http://shortn/_wqJYCYJPtL](http://shortn/_wqJYCYJPtL).

    Once the `DeviceBlockDevMode` is removed, you can now follow the guide from
    step 1.

5.  At the `Your are in developer mode` screen, press `Ctrl` + `d` to boot from
    internal disk.

6.  You will then see a screen that says `Preparing system for Developer Mode`.
    This may take some time, but the device will reboot when it is finished.

### B. Install Chrome OS from USB

We will now use the prepared flash drive to install a new version of Chrome OS
onto the chromebook.

1.  [Open root terminal](#open-root-terminal).
1.  Enable USB booting on the chromebook by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    crossystem dev_boot_usb=1
    ```

1.  [Boot from USB and Install](#boot-from-usb-and-install)

### C. Unlock Fingerprint System

We will now disable the Fingerprint MCU's flash protection mechanisms. In
addition to protecting the firmware on the MCU, these mechanism also control the
ability to capture fingerprints directly.

1.  [Open root terminal](#open-root-terminal).
1.  Run `gsctool -a -o` and press the power button when prompted. You will need
    to press the power button **multiple times** over the span of **5 minutes**.
    The device will reboot when finished. On boot, the device will report that
    `The OS image is invalid`. This is okay.

1.  After running `gsctool -a -p`, you device will go back into secure mode. You
    need to complete the *"Place Chromebook into Developer Mode"* section again.

1.  Plug in the Type-A side of the [CCD Cable] into the GNU/Linux machine and
    run the following command:

    ```bash
    watch -n 1 "lsusb | grep 18d1:5014"
    ```

1.  Plug the Type-C side of the [CCD Cable] into each port of the Chromebook,
    util you see a message like `Bus 001 Device 023: ID 18d1:5014 Google Inc.
    Cr50` on the GNU/Linux machine. The orientation of the Type-C end of the
    [CCD Cable] matters, so you may need to reverse the Type-C connector.

1.  Press `Ctrl - C` to exit the the watch prompt.

1.  Connect to the Cr50 console using the following command:

    ```bash
    minicom -D/dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

    This will open an interactive console to the onboard security chip. Press
    Enter to make sure that the console is responsive.

1.  In the console, enter the following:

    ```
    ccd reset factory
    ccd testlab enable
    ```

    Press the power button on the Chromebook when prompted.

1.  Exit minicom by pressing `Ctrl - A`, then `Q`, then `Enter`.

1.  Switch to the test Chrombook

1.  [Open root terminal](#open-root-terminal).

1.  Run the following command to reflash and reset the FPMCU:

    ```bash
    flash_fp_mcu
    ```

1.  [Ensure the security is removed from the FPMCU](#ensure-fpmcu-security).

See [CCD Open] and [CCD Cable] for more information.

1.  Follow the [boot from USB and install](#boot-from-usb-and-install) steps.
1.  Force [update FPMCU firmware](#update-fpmcu-firmware).

</details>

## 4. Log Firmware Versions and Check FPMCU Status

1.  Run `ectool --name=cros_fp version`.
2.  Record all output and send to Google for version verification.
3.  Ensure that the `Firmware copy` is `RW`.

## 5. Test the FPStudy Tool

1.  Login to the Chromebook using a test Gmail account.
2.  Navigate to `http://localhost:9000`.
3.  Start a capture using the onscreen steps.
4.  Ensure that the capture is deleted prior to starting the official study.

# Appendix

## A. Open Root Terminal {#open-root-terminal}

1.  Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `↻` (Ctrl-Alt-"refresh") to open a terminal. On older
    devices, it might be `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `➝` (Ctrl-Alt-"forward").
2.  Login as `root` with password `test0000` (the password may not be necessary)

***⚠️ Most of the commands in this tutorial cannot be run from the ChromeOS UI's
crosh shell, via Ctrl-Alt-T. You must run them using the method described above,
otherwise you may see a permission issue.***

## B. Alternative Root Terminal

After logging in using your test Gmail account, press `Ctrl-Alt-T`. Type
`shell`, press enter, type `sudo -i`, press enter, type `test0000` as the
password, and then press enter.

## C. Update FPMCU Firmware {#update-fpmcu-firmware}

1.  [Open root terminal](#open-root-terminal).
1.  Reflash the FPMCU firmware:

    ```bash
    flash_fp_mcu
    ```

## D. Ensure Security is Removed from FPMCU {#ensure-fpmcu-security}

Run the following command to ensure that FPMCU is in the proper security
configuration:

```bash
ectool --name=cros_fp flashprotect
```

Ensure that the first line reads `Flash protect flags: 0x00000000`, with no
additional words.

## E. Boot from USB and Install {#boot-from-usb-and-install}

1.  Plug the flash drive into the Chromebook.
1.  Reboot the Chromebook.

1.  When prompted with the OS verification screen, quickly press `Ctrl-U`, to
    boot from the USB flash drive.

    *If this operation is blocked, you need to enable usb booting first.
    Following the setup new Chromebook for fingerprint study.*

1.  When you see the Chrome OS login page, again,
    [Open root terminal](#open-root-terminal).

1.  Start the Chrome OS install, by issuing the following commands:

    ```bash
    chromeos-install
    # Press 'y' and then enter
    sync
    ```

1.  Reboot the chromebook using the following command:

    ```bash
    reboot
    ```

1.  When prompted with the OS verification screen, quickly press `Ctrl` + `D`,
    to boot from the internal "disk" (the new Chrome OS Install).

1.  Unplug the USB flash drive
