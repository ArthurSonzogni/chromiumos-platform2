#  CAP_NET_ADMIN = 0x0001000  for creating tap devices
#
# /proc is also remounted read-write because crosvm needs to be able to set the
# uid_map and gid_map for its child processes and that needs a writable /proc.

# The following mount flags are used below:
#  MS_BIND = 0x1000
#  MS_REC  = 0x4000

# -Kslave is applied to propagate imageloader mounts into concierge's mount
