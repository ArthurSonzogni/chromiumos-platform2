# VMs running in the system.

# Upstart expects the main process to call fork(2) twice.
# This means that it's not allowed to execute external commands in the script
# stanza other than the main process.
#
# Note that ChromeOS's upstart doesn't care processes that has forked and
# execed because of https://crrev.com/c/3097231. This behavior was implemented
# to support nesting minijail0. See https://crbug.com/1240118 for the detailed
# background.

  # Concierge needs to be able to configure user namespaces due to the
  # way ARC VM shares files with the host. This requires CAP_SETUID
  # and CAP_SETGID, but we can restrict the impact of this by running
  # concierge in an outer user namespace which only maps the uids
  # needed for the inner namespaces (except that concierge itself
  # needs access to a number of groups). We also need to map a number
  # of groups for concierge itself. The mapping does not renumber any
  # uids or gids to make the inner mappings easier to understand,
  # except that we are forced to map something to 0, and we use
  # crosvm-root for this purpose.
  #
  # uids:
  # - crosvm (299)
  # - crosvm-root (20182)
  # - arc-camera (603, but we have to map 600-649 for unclear reasons)
  # - Android (2,000,000 starting from 655360)
  #
  # gids:
  # - all of the above uids except crosvm-dbus, plus
  # - video (27)
  # - daemon-store (400)
