# Allow the following capabilities:
#
#  CAP_NET_ADMIN = 0x0001000  for creating tap devices
#
# Raise the above capabilities in the ambient set so that they can be inherited
# by child processes.
#
# /proc is also remounted read-write because crosvm needs to be able to set the
# uid_map and gid_map for its child processes and that needs a writable /proc.

# The following mount flags are used below:
#  MS_BIND = 0x1000
#  MS_REC  = 0x4000
