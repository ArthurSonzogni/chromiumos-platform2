# VMs running in the system.

# If we are using plugin VMs then we will start concierge together with the
# dispatcher, otherwise concierge will be started explicitly.

# Allow the following capabilities:
#
#  CAP_SETGID    for allowing mapping additional gids in user namespaces
#                of jailed children. It will be added to the ambient set
#                by concierge
#  CAP_NET_ADMIN for creating tap devices
#
# /proc is also remounted read-write because crosvm needs to be able to set the
# uid_map and gid_map for its child processes and that needs a writable /proc.
#
# The following mount flags are used below:
#  MS_BIND = 0x1000
#  MS_REC  = 0x4000
#
# -Kslave is applied to propagate imageloader mounts into concierge's mount
