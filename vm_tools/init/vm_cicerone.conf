pre-start script
  # Set the iptables rules to allow the container inside a VM to communicate
  # back with the host over gRPC. Ports are defined in:
  # src/platform2/vm_tools/common/constants.h
  #
  # Open port for garcon.
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8889 -i vmtap+ -j ACCEPT -w
end script

post-stop script
  # Close port for garcon.

# Launch this process jailed with a new IPC namespace, new PID
# namespace, new cgroup namespace, new network namespace, new UTS
# namespace, no new privileges, drop all caps, new mount namespace,
# remount /proc, launch as user/group vm_cicerone, inherit
# supplementary groups for vm_cicerone, set up seccomp-bpf. The new
# mount namespace is a slave of the main namespace so we can inherit
# the mounts of new cryptohomes as sessions are started and ended,
# which is required to write crash reports into those cryptohomes.
#
# We run as init in the new PID namespace so we don't have to keep a
# minijail process around.
