description    "Check an config value and start vm_concierge if it's disabled"
author         "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job just provides a trigger event for vm_concierge to start at
# "start-user-session" for a finch experiment. vm_concierge.conf waits for
# "started vm_concierge_nodefer" event or "started-user-sesison" event by the
# "start on" stanza. This job starts successfully if the DeferConciergeStartup
# config is disabled (or failed to check the config value as the default
# behavior).
# TODO(b/353431869): remove this conf when the finch experiment is finished

start on start-user-session
stop on started vm_concierge

# This job itself does nothing.
