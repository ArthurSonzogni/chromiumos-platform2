# This file may be modified to make local changes to the command line that
# ARCVM uses to start a VM. It contains one directive per line, with the
# following forms available:
#
#    # This is a comment.
#      Lines beginning with '#' are skipped.
#
#    --some-flag=some-value
#      Appends "--some-flag" and "some-value" to command line.
#
#    --some-flag
#      Appends "--some-flag" to command line.
#
#    !--flag-prefix
#      Removes all arguments beginning with "--flag-prefix".
#
#    KERNEL_PATH=/set/to/new_path
#      Override the guest kernel path to /set/to/new_path. KERNEL_PATH must
#      consist of capital letters.
#
# Directives are applied in the order they appear (i.e. to change a flag, first
# delete it and then re-add it with the desired value).
#
# Setting values on environment variables is not supported.
