# Since we are in an unprivileged user namespace, all bind mounts require the
# MS_REC flag to also be set and bind mounting / recursively defeats the purpose
# of using pivot_root.  Instead we use nested jails: one to set up the mounts
# and another to create the user namespace.  /proc needs to be mounted read-
# write so that we can set the uid and gid maps.
#
# -Kslave is applied to propagate /media (drivefs and removable media), and
# /run/arc/sdcard (android) mounts into seneschal's mount namespace.
#
# Map uid/gid android-root (655360) and gid android-everybody (665357).
