# Minijail settings:
# -i exit immediately after fork
# -u run as user hpsd
# -g run as group hpsd
# -n set no_new_privs
# -R RLIMIT_NICE,40,40 to allow niceness of -20
# -T static to apply the sandbox policy before exec, so that cros_hpsd doesn't
#    need any additional SELinux privileges for doing the same
# --profile=minimalistic-mountns-nodev to set up a mostly empty pivot root
#
# Namespaces:
# -N enter new cgroup namespace
# --uts enter new UTS/hostname namespace
# -e enter new network namespace
# -p enter new pid namespace
#
# Mounts:
# -k to mount tmpfs at /run and /var (writable)
# -b /var/lib/metrics (writable) to enable UMA
# -b /var/lib/hpsd (writable) for UMA cumulative metrics
#
# For I2C:
# -b /dev (writable)
# -b /sys
# -b /sys/bus
# -b /sys/class
# -b /sys/devices (writable)
#
# For DBUS:
# -b /run/dbus
