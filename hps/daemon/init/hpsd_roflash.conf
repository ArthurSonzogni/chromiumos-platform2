description   "Flash ro of hps before hpsd starts"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# hpsd will still start if this fails
# we could add this to hpsd.conf if needed:
# start on stopped hpsd_roflash RESULT=ok
start on starting hpsd
task

# This must not be killed as there is a small chance
# it could leave the HPS device bricked.
oom score never
# Typical vsize for hps-factory is 2756 KiB, allow some headroom
limit as 20000000 unlimited

# Initialise the HPS before starting hpsd. The hps-factory command will:
# 1. Unbind the cros-hps kernel driver, which will power *on* the HPS
#    peripheral on its way out.
# 2. If HPS is in the STM bootloader (I2C address 0x51) because its flash is
#    blank, write stage0. If HPS is already in stage0 (I2C address 0x30),
#    check the stage0 version register, and erase and re-write stage0 if the
#    version is different.
# 3. Bind the cros-hps kernel driver.
