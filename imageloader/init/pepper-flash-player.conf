# Note that "starting ui" blocks UI startup. This is intentional here since the
# flash player component must be available when the browser starts since the
# sandbox/zygote can currently only access flash binaries if they're available
# at startup.

# Try to mount flash player if it exists.
# If it does not exist, that is OK: just let imageloader fail.
# To simplify things, we mount the flash image in a pre-determined location that
# Chrome knows about.
