# This is started by D-Bus service activation through
# org.chromium.Imageloader.service.

# Stop service when imageloader-shutdown is starting.
# Ideally startup should also be blocked during shutdown, but stopping
# during a imageloader-shutdown stanza covers most use cases.
# The stop during stopping of ui is added as that indicates a session change.
# (Rather than depending on `logout`, `ui` is used as that's what `logout`
# depends on for state change)
stop on starting imageloader-shutdown or stopping ui

# Allow us to be killed as we are not critical to the system.  If we have a
# leak, better to crash & restart than to OOM-panic the system.

# Start imageloader.

# Wait for daemon to claim its D-Bus name before transitioning to started.
