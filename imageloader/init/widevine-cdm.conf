# Note that "starting ui" blocks UI startup. This is intentional here as the
# Widevine CDM component must be available when the browser starts since the
# sandbox/zygote can currently only access binaries if they're available at
# startup.

# Try to mount Widevine CDM if it exists.
# If it does not exist, that is OK: just let imageloader fail.
# The image is mounted in a pre-determined location that Chrome
# (chrome/browser/component_updater/widevine_cdm_component_installer.cc)
# knows about.
