# screen-capture-utils

Utilities for screen capturing for dev/test
images for working with screen capture.

## screenshot

Provides a screenshot of the current display. Useful for capturing what's on the
display when test has failed, for example.  Not all devices are supported yet,
so your mileage may vary.

## kmsvnc

have tested with VNC client for Chrome.
