# screen-capture-utils

Utilities for screen capturing for dev/test
images for working with screen capture.

## screenshot

Provides a screenshot of the current display. Useful for capturing what's on the
display when test has failed, for example.  Not all devices are supported yet,
so your mileage may vary.

## kmsvnc

VNC server using the same infrastructure as screenshot for grabbing display.

Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of how to use kmsvnc.

```shell
(DUT)# kmsvnc
```

VNC server will start listening on port 5900. Forward the port with SSH from
your client, and connect through the port. Example:

```shell
(workstation)$ ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 DUT
```

Then connect using a VNC client, such as [VNC Viewer for Google
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vnc%C2%AE-viewer-for-google-ch/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla)
to localhost:5900. It will ask you if you want to connect unauthenticated, here
we are relying on ssh forwarding to restrict who can connect.

## Development notes

### Building and testing

For development I typically deploy to /usr/local/ because tests expect them there.

```
$ BOARD=rammus-arc-r
$ setup_board --board=${BOARD}  # required only once per board.
$ cros_workon --board=${BOARD} start screen-capture-utils
$ emerge-${BOARD} -j 100 chromeos-base/screen-capture-utils
$ cros deploy --root=/usr/local/ localhost:2229 chromeos-base/screen-capture-utils
$ tast run localhost:2229 graphics.KmsvncConnect
$ tast run localhost:2229 graphics.Smoke.platform
```

For debugging I typically need to deploy to /usr/sbin, from inside chroot

```
$ cros deploy localhost:2229 chromeos-base/screen-capture-utils
$ gdb-${BOARD} --remote=localhost:2229 /usr/sbin/kmsvnc
```

### Type of graphics importer

There are three major types of boards that this code handles.  The flags
`--method=bo` or `--method=egl` would try to force which method is being used.

#### non-getfb2-capable

Kernel before 4.4 do not have [getfb2 ioctl
backported](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/2001263/4),
so they will use the `--method=bo`. This does not support multiple planes and
assumes framebuffer is readable in ARGB format.

Development was done typically with caroline.

#### getfb2-capable

framebuffer is converted every frame to ARGB format using EGL call. This depends
on getfb2 ioctl being available, which is only available on kernel 4.4 or later.

Development was done typically with samus.

#### getfb2-capable and atomic_modeset capable

planes are scanned and merged so that when multiple planes are being used they
are correctly rendered.

Development was done typically with rammus.
