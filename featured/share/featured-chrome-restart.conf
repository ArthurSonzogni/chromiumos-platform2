description     "ChromiumOS feature daemon restart helper"
author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# Features managed in chrome can change state when the browser restarts. So,
# send a dbus signal each time ash is re-initialized (that is, whenever the
# browser restarts).
# Services that want to receive the most recent feature state (NOTABLY INCLUDING
# state controlled by chrome://flags) must listen to this event and take action
# to fetch new state (e.g. restarting) when it happens.

task

# This service enables services to determine when they should restart to pick
# up new feature state from the browser. It is exceedingly unlikely to OOM,
# as it's a simple dbus-send call, but better to kill it than to panic the
# system.
