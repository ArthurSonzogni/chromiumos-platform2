This is the Chromium OS 'bootstat' utility.  The utility is used
to generate timestamps and other performance statistics during
system boot.

==== Functional specification
Usage:
    bootstat <event-name>

Summary:  The command gathers and records the contents of
/proc/uptime and disk statistics for the boot disk (the full disk,
not the boot partition), and associates the data with the passed
in <event-name>.

==== Design details and API
Uptime data are stored in a file named /tmp/uptime-<event-name>;
disk statistics are stored in a file named /tmp/disk-<event-name>.
This file naming convention is a concession to existing code that
depends on these files existing with these specific names, including
the platform_BootPerf test in autotest, /etc/boot-complete.conf, and
portions of Chrome.

New code should treat the file names as an implementation detail,
not as the interface.  You should not add new code that depends on
the file names; instead, you should enhance the bootstat command
and/or library to provide access to the data you need.

==== Code conventions
This is currently C code, because a) the code is intended for use
as a library accessible to C and C++ code, and b) it's too small to
make sense using C++ features.  However, if the program grows, it
may be appropriate to convert all or part to C++.

To the extent that the code should be acceptable to a C++ compiler,
it should also adhere to Google's C++ coding conventions.  In areas
where the code is C specific, use your best judgement (note that
Google also has Objective-C coding conventions that may be useful).
