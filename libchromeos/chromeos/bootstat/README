This is the Chromium OS 'bootstat' utility.  The utility is used
to generate timestamps and other performance statistics during
system boot.

Usage:
    bootstat <event-name>

Summary:  The command gathers and records the contents of
/proc/uptime and disk statistics for the boot disk (the full disk,
not the boot partition), and associates the data with the passed
in <event-name>.

Implementation:  Uptime data are stored in a file named
/tmp/uptime-<event-name>; disk statistics are stored in a file
named /tmp/disk-<event-name>.  This file naming convention is a
concession to existing code that depends on these files existing
with these specific names, including the platform_BootPerf test in
autotest, /etc/boot-complete.conf, and portions of Chrome.

New code should treat the file names as an implementation detail,
not as the interface.  You should not add new code that depends on
the file names; instead, you should enhance the bootstat command
and/or library to provide access to the data you need.
