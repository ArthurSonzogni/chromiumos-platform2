# ChromeOS Flex HWIS

HWIS is the ChromeOS Flex Hardware Information Service. This utility and
library collects and sends hardware information from ChromeOS Flex devices
to a server. This information is used to perform impact analysis when
dealing with releases, particularly in terms of support regressions, but
also for adding support for new hardware with a new release. Having a full
hardware profile of a machine also allows us to diagnose unique hardware
component interactions.

All hardware information sent by the utility is obtained from cros_healthd
via the mojo interface and translated into the protobuf format. Before
sending the data, the following checking steps are required:

1.  Check last run time
    The ChromeOS Flex HWIS utility will run after the user successfully
    logs in. The utility needs to check if it has run successfully within
    the last 24 hours. If it has been less than 24 hours since a successful
    run, then the utility exits.

2.  Confirm user permission
    The utility needs to check if the user permission is granted. In the
    unenrolled case, the tool will check if permission has been granted
    via the OOBE. In the enrolled case, the utility needs to check that
    the following device management policy is enabled:
    * DeviceFlexHwDataForProductImprovementEnabled

3.  Read and check the UUID
    The utility should read the UUID from `/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid`
    and store it at `/var/lib/flex_hwis_tool/uuid`. If the UUID was just
    generated, the client will interact with the server by POST request.
    If the UUID already exists, then it will be a PUT request.

## Hardware Cache

This utility also handles creating an easily-read, on-disk cache of hardware
data, for consumption by processes where making mojo requests is undesirable.

On startup, `/etc/init/flex_hardware_cache.conf` handles running the tool to
create a cache in `/run/flex_hardware/`. Each hardware value will be stored in
a file with a name matching the keys we use to send the value in feedback and
crash reports. Those keys are listed in the `system_api/constants/flex_hwis.h`
header.

## Device metrics

The `flex_device_metrics` directory contains a tool for sending metrics
about the device. Individual metrics are described in subsections.

The `flex_device_metrics` tool runs once per boot via an upstart
task. You can run `flex_device_metrics` directly to see it in action (or
`start flex_device_metrics` to run it in minijail via upstart).

### Disk partition layout

Normal ChromeOS boards have a fixed disk layout for the lifetime of the
board, but ChromeOS Flex has long-lived installations and occasionally
migrates the disk layout during the update process.

The partition metrics can be checked locally by navigating to
`chrome://histograms`. The current set of metrics:
* `Platform.FlexPartitionSize.EFI-SYSTEM`
* `Platform.FlexPartitionSize.KERN-A`
* `Platform.FlexPartitionSize.KERN-B`
* `Platform.FlexPartitionSize.ROOT-A`
* `Platform.FlexPartitionSize.ROOT-B`

These are sparse metrics, meaning the exact value is reported rather
than a bucket spanning a range of values.

### CPU ISA level

ChromeOS Flex runs on a wide range of x86-64 CPUs. This enum metric
categorizes the CPU by its ISA level. See [isa-levels] for details of
the levels.

### Boot Method

ChromeOS Flex requires 64-bit CPUs. On a small number of devices,
even though the CPU is 64-bit, the UEFI environment is 32-bit.
This enum metric reports the method used to boot the device. This can be
BIOS/legacy, Coreboot, 32-bit UEFI, or 64-bit UEFI.

## Bootloader log

The `init/upstart/flex_boot_log.conf` upstart script copies the UEFI
bootloader log (if present) from a UEFI variable to `/var/log`.

### Testing

Googlers only: For information on access, where and how to view your data,
see go/hwis-googlers-info.

To test your changes to `flex_hwis_tool`, you can run it directly on a Flex
test image.

```
reven ~ # flex_hwis_tool
```

`flex_hwis_tool` is gated to run once per day per device. To run more than once on your device delete the file at `/var/lib/flex_hwis_tool/time`.
