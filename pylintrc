[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple times.
# eq-without-hash: We omit this as we don't require all objects be hashable.
#   We'll wait for unittest coverage to detect missing __hash__ on objects.
# no-absolute-import: We don't seem to rely on this behavior, so don't enforce
#   using this future import everywhere.
# round-builtin: We omit this as all our usage of round() is OK with either
#   Python 2 or 3 behavior (and probably leans towards 3 anyways).

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You

# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
