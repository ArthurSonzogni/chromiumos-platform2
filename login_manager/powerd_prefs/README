This directory contains preference files for power_manager (powerd) that specify
freeze order dependencies for programs launched by this package. For more
details on freeze ordering, see the 'Suspend Freezer' section in

suspend_freezer_deps_ui: The ui freezer cgroup, which contains Chrome, depends
on various FUSE related freezer cgroups. These cgroups contain the FUSE daemons
for filesystems that processes in the ui freezer cgroup can access. The
dependencies listed in suspend_freezer_deps_ui allow us to freeze the ui cgroup
before the FUSE related freezer cgroups, avoiding timeouts on suspend due to
FUSE.
