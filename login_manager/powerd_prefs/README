This directory contains preference files for power_manager (powerd) that specify
freeze order dependencies for programs launched by this package. For more
details on freeze ordering, see the 'Suspend Freezer' section in
chromiumos/src/platform2/power_manager/docs/suspend_resume.md.

suspend_freezer_deps_ui: The ui freezer cgroup, which contains Chrome, depends
on various FUSE related freezer cgroups. These cgroups contain the FUSE daemons
for filesystems that processes in the ui freezer cgroup can access. The
dependencies listed in suspend_freezer_deps_ui allow us to freeze the ui cgroup
before the FUSE related freezer cgroups, avoiding timeouts on suspend due to
FUSE.

suspend_freezer_deps_session_manager_containers: The session_manager_containers
freezer cgroup, which contains ARC, depends on the virtual-file-provider cgroup.
The virtual-file-provider cgroup contains a FUSE daemon used to access resources
via Chrome. The dependency listed in
suspend_freezer_deps_session_manager_containers allows us to freeze
session_manager_containers before virtual-file-provider, avoiding freeze
timeouts on suspend due to FUSE.
