description   "Extract Chrome OS machine info for Enterprise enrollment"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# /tmp/machine-info contains the serial number and other information that may
# identify the device. This information is required by OOBE and enterprise
# enrollment, but we don't want it around otherwise for privacy reasons. Thus,
# we generate as long as /home/.shadow/install_attributes.pb is not present.
# That file is created by cryptohome once the device has been
# enterprise-enrolled or been claimed by a local user.
#
# Old versions of Chromium OS (11 and earlier) didn't have the code generating
# install_attributes.pb in cryptohome when claiming the device, so the check
# would fail for users upgrading from devices that have been setup originally
# on these versions. Our best-effort attmept at catching this is to also check
# for /var/lib/whitelist/owner.key. Note that this may not work perfectly once
# we have support for transitioning ownership.

# This starts every time the UI (re)starts in order to restore
# /tmp/machine-info if needed.
start on starting ui

# Remove /tmp/machine-info when a user logs in, in which case session_manager
# emits the start-user-session signal. Also stop when the ui terminates so
# restarts of the ui job trigger a full stop/start cycle.
stop on start-user-session or stopping ui

env MACHINE_INFO=/tmp/machine-info

# This is a pre-start so that this task will run before the "start" stanza
# of the ui job.
