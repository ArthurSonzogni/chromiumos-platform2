description   "Supplemental session_manager initialization after boot"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job forwards machine information to session_manager over DBus.
# The data is used by session_manager eventually, but is not critical to
# starting the UI.

# Machine information needs to be pushed to session_manager every time
# it starts. However, the data may not be available yet. In that case
# this job runs again after ui-collect-machine-info has collected the
# data.

  # Bail out if data collection is still pending.

  # Note the tr command below that fixes up the input data to only
  # contain ASCII characters. Well-formed input should only contain
  # ASCII characters anyways. However, there are devices in the wild
  # that have random invalid binary data in their VPD.
  #
  # Sanitization is necessary here because dbus-send asserts the input
  # string to be valid UTF-8. Without sanitization, these asserts
  # generate crash reports for dbus-send and fail to forward potentially
  # intact VPD contents. See also http://crbug.com/438166.
