# This job forwards machine information to session_manager over DBus.
# The data is used by session_manager eventually, but is not critical to
# starting the UI.

# Machine information needs to be pushed to session_manager every time
# it starts. However, the data may not be available yet. In that case
# this job runs again after ui-collect-machine-info has collected the
# data.
