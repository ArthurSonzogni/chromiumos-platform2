# This job's post-stop script depends on cryptohomed being running;
# cryptohomed in turn depends on chapsd and dbus-daemon.  This job's
# stop condition uses a special stop job to keep those processes
# from terminating until after this job has cleaned up.  See the
# pre-shutdown job for more details.
# NB: Respawning is now handled by ui-respawn.conf, as the logic is
# more complex than upstart was designed to handle.
