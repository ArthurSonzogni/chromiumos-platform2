Description:

Autotest label detector for audio/video/camera. This tool will do very basic
detections to suggest what autotest labels to apply. The full detailed tests
are done in their corresponding tests, not here.

How to use it:
Run "avtest_label_detect" and it will output lines like
"Detected label: webcam" (one line for one label).
