# Feature usage metrics

Design doc for [Sharing SFUL in Chrome & ChromeOS](go/sful-in-chrome-cros).

Any changes should first be made to the feature usage library in chromium [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chromeos/components/feature_usage/), then exported to ChromeOS.
