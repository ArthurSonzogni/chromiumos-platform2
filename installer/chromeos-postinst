# USB-key install time. It will be mounted following an upgrade. ChromeOS
# hardware expects the kernel to be in a partition of its own. Legacy systems
# will use syslinux to boot from the kernel image found in the rootfs.
# TODO: The ChromeOS kernel partition will contain a signature header, a config
# file, and the kernel image as a single blob. We'll need to revisit this to
# ensure that gets installed properly.
