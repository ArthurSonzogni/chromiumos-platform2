# This script is called after an AutoUpdate or USB install. This script is a
# simple wrapper to convert from the hardcoded command line to the new
# executable command line.

# NOTE: This script is called by installers like `chromeos-install` or
# `update_engine` from inside the mounted rootfs of the target image. So it is
# perfectly fine to modify this script without caring about backward/forward
# compatibility. But it can never be migrated to a non-shell script because it
# is being called by the original installer and that can break things badly.
