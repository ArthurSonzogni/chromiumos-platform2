                        The tag can be shared across many devices if desired, but
                        this will result in larger granularity for metrics
                        reporting.  Ideally the metrics system should support
                        collation of metrics with different tags into groups, but if
                        this is not supported, this tag can be used to achieve the
                        same end.  This is reported in 'ro.product.metrics.tag'.

                    model to use in the factory during the finalization stage. Note
                    that if the VPD is wiped then the model will be lost. This may
                    mean that the device will revert back to a generic model, or
                    may not work. It is not possible in general to test whether the
                    model in the VPD is correct at run-time. We simply assume that
                    it is. The advantage of using this property is that no hardware
                    changes are needed to change one model into another. For example
                    we can create 20 different whitelabel boards, all with the same

                    tasks. When an urgent thread is created, chrome applies
                    this value to scheduler attribute. Tasks with higher
                    boost value are more likely to have higher operating
                    power point even when the system is low utilized.

                    topmost applications. When top-app class application is
                    running, ARCVM applies this value to scheduler attribute.
                    Tasks with higher boost value are more likely to have higher
                    operating power point even when the system is low-utilized.
                    If it is not set, the default value will be calculated by
                    the performance ratio of the highest performance core and
                    the lowest performance core. So the recommended value is
                    higher than that. 0 means no boost and is not recommended.

                    the boost-arcvm is directly converted to % boost value,
                    where 1.0 is 100%. For the little.Big architecture, the
                    ARCVM will be boosted by a % value, calculated from the
                    formula
                      little-core-freq / big-core-freq * boost-arcvm.
                    Besides boosting the scheduler for the VM by a % value, the
                    cgroup's uclamp.latency_sensitive attribute is enabled to
                    further reduce the scheduling latency.
                    Note - this is intended to be a temporary solution, which
                    will be removed upon having the more appropriate scheduler
                    improvements ready.
