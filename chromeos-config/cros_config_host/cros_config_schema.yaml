                    This option is often useful when a model is first added,
                    since it may not have firmware at that point.

                    Instead the model is stored in the VPD (Vital Product Data) region in the
                    customization_id property. This allows us to determine the
                    model to use in the factory during the finalization stage. Note
                    that if the VPD is wiped then the model will be lost. This may
                    mean that the device will revert back to a generic model, or
                    may not work. It is not possible in general to test whether the
                    model in the VPD is correct at run-time. We simply assume that
                    it is. The advantage of using this property is that no hardware
                    changes are needed to change one model into another. For example
                    we can create 20 different whitelabel boards, all with the same
                    hardware, just by changing the customization_id that is written
                    into SPI flash.

                (for the YAML and C++ that uses it); likely though some type of code generation.
                SUMMARY -- Contains power_manager device settings.  This is the new mechanism used
                in lieu of the previous file based implementation (via powerd-prefs).
                Power manager will first check for a property in this config, else it will revert
                to the file based mechanism (via the powerd-prefs setting).
                This provides more flexibility in sharing power settings across different devices
                that share the same build overlay.
                Any property can be overridden from - src/platform2/power_manager/default_prefs or
                src/platform2/power_manager/optional_prefs
                For details about each setting property, see -
                src/platform2/power_manager/common/power_constants.h
                For examples on setting these properties (including multiline examples), see
