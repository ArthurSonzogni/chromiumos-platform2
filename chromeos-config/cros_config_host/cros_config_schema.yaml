                        The tag can be shared across many models if desired, but
                        this will result in larger granularity for metrics
                        reporting.  Ideally the metrics system should support
                        collation of metrics with different tags into groups, but if
                        this is not supported, this tag can be used to achieve the
                        same end.  This is reported in 'ro.product.metrics.tag'.

                    (chromeos-firmware- ebuild) and it will not be included in the signer

                    This option is often useful when a model is first added,

                    Indicates that this model cannot be decoded by the mapping table.
                    Instead the model is stored in the VPD (Vital Product Data) region in the
                    customization_id property. This allows us to determine the
                    model to use in the factory during the finalization stage. Note
                    that if the VPD is wiped then the model will be lost. This may
                    mean that the device will revert back to a generic model, or
                    may not work. It is not possible in general to test whether the
                    model in the VPD is correct at run-time. We simply assume that
                    it is. The advantage of using this property is that no hardware
                    changes are needed to change one model into another. For example
                    we can create 20 different whitelabel boards, all with the same
                    hardware, just by changing the customization_id that is written
                    into SPI flash.
