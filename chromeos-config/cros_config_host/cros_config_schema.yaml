                    Instead the model is stored in the VPD (Vital Product Data) region in the
                    customization_id property. This allows us to determine the
                    model to use in the factory during the finalization stage. Note
                    that if the VPD is wiped then the model will be lost. This may
                    mean that the device will revert back to a generic model, or
                    may not work. It is not possible in general to test whether the
                    model in the VPD is correct at run-time. We simply assume that
                    it is. The advantage of using this property is that no hardware
                    changes are needed to change one model into another. For example
                    we can create 20 different whitelabel boards, all with the same
                    hardware, just by changing the customization_id that is written
                    into SPI flash.

                code that is consumed by the EC build process in order to do
                run-time configuration. If a value is defined within a config
                file, but not for a specific model, that value will be assumed
                to be false for that model. If a value is an enum and is not

                properties are desired, the generation code in
                cros_config_schema.py must be updated to support them.
