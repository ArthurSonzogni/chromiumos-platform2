# Run cros-disks under minijail as follows:
# - Enter new IPC (-l) namespace.
#
# - Remain in the original network namespace in order to join to the system
#   DBus.
#
# - Remain in the original cgroup namespace as it isn't supported on systems
#   running kernel 3.8. TODO(benchan): Put cros-disks in new cgroup namespace
#   once all systems support it.
#
# - Temporarily skip new mount (-v) and PID (-p) namespace as cros-disks
#   needs to access /home/user/<hash> for archive support, which isn't
#   accessible inside a new mount namesapce. TODO(benchan): Put cros-disks in
#   new mount and PID namespace after archive support in cros-disks is
#   deprecated (chromium:707327).
#
# - To let upstart to track the cros-disks process properly according to the
#   'expect fork' stanza, minijail exits immediately after fork (-i) while
#   cros-disks stays in foreground (--foreground) without daemonizing itself
#   inside the new pid namespace.
#
# - Use -K to prevent minijail to remount the shared mount at /media private.
#   TODO(benchan): Remove -K once minijail provides a finer control over
#   what should be remounted private and what can remain shared (b:62056108).
#
# - TODO(benchan): Use -c to remove unnecessary capabilities from cros-disks.
