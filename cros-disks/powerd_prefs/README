This directory contains preference files for power_manager (powerd) that specify
freeze order dependencies for programs launched by this package. For more
details on freeze ordering, see the 'Suspend Freezer' section in
chromiumos/src/platform2/power_manager/docs/suspend_resume.md.

suspend_freezer_deps_fuse-zip, suspend_freezer_deps_rar2fs: The fuse-zip and
rar2fs freezer cgroups, which contain the respective FUSE daemons, depend on any
cgroup that manages a filesystem which an archive may be mounted from. The
dependencies listed in suspend_freezer-deps_fuse-zip/rar2fs allows us to freeze
the fuse-zip and rar2fs cgroups before the other FUSE related cgroups, avoiding
timeouts on suspend due to FUSE.
