This directory contains preference files for power_manager (powerd) that specify
freeze order dependencies for programs launched by this package. For more
details on freeze ordering, see the 'Suspend Freezer' section in

suspend_freezer_deps_{fuse-archive,mount-zip,rar2fs}: The fuse-archive,
mount-zip and rar2fs freezer cgroups, which contain the respective FUSE
daemons, depend on any cgroup that manages a filesystem which an archive may be
mounted from. The dependencies listed in suspend_freezer-deps_* allows us to
freeze the fuse-archive, mount-zip and rar2fs cgroups before the other FUSE
related cgroups, avoiding timeouts on suspend due to FUSE.
