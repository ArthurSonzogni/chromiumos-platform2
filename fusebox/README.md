FuseBox provides a FUSE layer interface over chrome::storage virtual file
systems (eg., Media Transport Protocol (MTP), Files System Provider (FSP),
Android Documents Provider (ADP), and Android Content Providers (ACP)) to
make their file content available to POSIX file API system calls from the
Linux operating system.
