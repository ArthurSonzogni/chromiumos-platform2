description   "Chrome OS camera service failsafe"
author        "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# By default we need cros-camera to start when all the built-in camera(s) are
# probed by the kernel, so that we can report the correct static built-in camera
# info to the camera clients.  However, if any of the built-in cameras cannot be
# probed successfully (e.g. hardware failure), we still need cros-camera to run
# so users get to use external USB cameras.

# cros-camera has `respawn limit 10 60`. The failsafe is triggered when
# cros-camera fails to start after 10 retries in 60 seconds and transitions to
# `stopped`.
#
# When cros-camera is gracefully stopped, ${RESULT} is set to `ok`.  We don't
# need to trigger the failsafe in this case (e.g. user running `stop
# cros-camera`, or cros-camera stops in pre-start because system-services
# isn't ready).
start on stopped cros-camera RESULT="failed"

# Make the camera jobs killable, because if it has a leak it's better to restart
# it than to OOM-panic.
