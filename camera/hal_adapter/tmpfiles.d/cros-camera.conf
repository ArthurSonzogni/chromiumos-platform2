# On devices with Chrome OS camera HAL, Chrome needs to host the Unix domain
# named socket /run/camera/camera3.sock to provide the camera HAL Mojo
# service to the system. The socket is created and listened on by Chrome, and
# receives connections from the camera HAL v3 process and cameraserver process
# in Android container which run as group arc-camera.  In addition, the camera
# HAL v3 process also hosts a Unix domain named socket in /run/camera for the
# sandboxed camera library process. Feature flag files are located in this
# directory such as `force_enable_effects`, and the existence of this may need
# to be checked by any user, thus the directory is created with user chronos and
# group arc-camera with 0771 permission.
d= /run/camera 0771 chronos arc-camera

# Ensure that the token directories exists so that it can be bind-mounted into
# the minijail that cros-camera runs in.
d= /run/camera_tokens 0770 chronos arc-camera
d= /run/camera_tokens/server 0770 chronos arc-camera

# The /var/cache/camera folder is used to store camera-related configs and
# settings that are either extracted from Android container, or generated
# by the camera HAL at runtime.
