 * \brief Initialize IA_AEC
 * This function must be called before any other function in the library. It allocates memories for all AEC algorithms based on input parameters
 * given by the user. AIQB (from CPFF). Initialization returns a handle to the AEC instance, which is given as input parameter for all the
 * subsequent calls to this library. Therefore, multiple instances of AEC can running simultaneously. For example one instance per camera.
 *
 * \param[in]     atbx              Analysis Toolbox handle. AEC will use it to get statistics analysis results.
 * \param[in]     aiqb_data         Contains tuning parameters for AEC algorithms. NULL, if built-ion defaults are to be used.
 * return                           IA_AEC handle. Use the returned handle as input parameter for the consequent IA_AEC calls.
