# The SafeSetID LSM uses this list to record which UID’s/GID’s to restrict, look here for more information:
# https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/LSM/SafeSetID.html

# The entries below are formatted as UID1:UID2, meaning:
# "a process with UID1 is allowed to change its UID to UID2"

# VM's root user (0) maps to hosts nobody (65534)
# VM's default user (1000) maps to hosts shadercached (333)
# nobody:shadercached
65534:333
