# TODO(b/261074016): Get away with using -c CAP_SYS_ADMIN for the mount and swap
# operations.
# Need access to /proc, /sys, /dev to perform swap operations.
# Need (writable) access to /var/lib/swap to set the zram size.
# Need (writable) access to /var/lib/metrics to write UMA data.
# Need (writable) access to
# /mnt/stateful_partition/unencrypted/userspace_swap.tmp to create actual
# writeback space.
# Need access to /run/dbus for DBus communications.
# Need (writable) access to /proc/sys/vm to initialize min_filelist_kbytes.
