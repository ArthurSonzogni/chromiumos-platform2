# It is exceedingly unlikely to OOM, as it's a simple dbus-send call,

# There is a race condition with chromeos_shutdown (b/267224195) that causes
# swap_management to be killed by process_killer before it can properly process
# a D-Bus message here. To avoid this and ensure that zram swap stops, we run
# swap_management directly instead of using dbus-send.
# Once the issue above is resolved, we should consider using D-Bus messages.
