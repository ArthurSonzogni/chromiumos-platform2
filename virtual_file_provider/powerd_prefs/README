suspend_freezer_deps_virtual-file-provider: The virtual-file-provider freezer
cgroup depends on the ui freezer cgroup. This is because the filesystem
operations via the FUSE daemon for the virtual-file-provider block on Chrome
(which is part of the ui freezer cgroup). The dependency listed in
suspend_freezer_deps_virtual-file-provider allows us to freeze the
virtual-file-provider cgroup before the ui cgroup, avoiding timeouts on suspend
due to FUSE.
