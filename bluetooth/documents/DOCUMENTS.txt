NewBlue daemon's D-Bus APIs are based on BlueZ's D-Bus API. *-api.txt files
list the D-Bus methods and properties supported by NewBlue Daemon. For each
method/property, the difference between NewBlue and BlueZ is pointed out;
otherwise there is no description. The implementation of each *api.txt can be
found under newblued/, e.g. newblued/device_interface_handler.cc.

The following annotations are used in comments to indicate the support.

// NOT IMPLEMENTED
The method/property is not yet but should be supported by NewBlue daemon.

// NOT IMPLEMENTED AS INTENDED
The method/property is not supported by NewBlue Daemon as intended.
