# How to use plantuml files

These files are writen in using [plantuml](https://github.com/plantuml).
Several tools chains can be used to render the final diagrams including command
line or IDE integration.  Chances are your favorite editor supports it or has
an available plugin.

Short of installing the tool change, a [chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plantuml-viewer/legbfeljfbjgfifnkmpoajgpgejojooj)
is also available.
