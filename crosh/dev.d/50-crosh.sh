  WARNING: This is bleeding edge software and is often more buggy than the dev
  channel.  Please do not use this unless you are a developer.  This is often
  updated daily and has only passed automated tests -- the QA level is low!

  This channel may not always boot reliably or have a functioning auto update
  mechanism. Do not do this unless you are prepared to recover your Chrome OS
  device, please be familiar with this article first:
