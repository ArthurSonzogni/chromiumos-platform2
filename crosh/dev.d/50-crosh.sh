  Start/stop system tracing.  Turning tracing off will generate a trace
  log file in the Downloads directory with all the events collected
  since the last time tracing was enabled.  One can control the events
  collected by specifying categories after "start"; e.g. "start gfx"
  will collect only graphics-related system events.  "systrace status"
  (or just "systrace") will display the current state of tracing, including
  the set of events being traced.
