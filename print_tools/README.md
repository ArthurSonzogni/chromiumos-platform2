# print_tools: various tools related to the native printing system

## printer_diag

This tool sends to a given printer (or other IPP endpoint)
Get-Printer-Attributes request and returns the received response. The response
is parsed and can be saved both as JSON file or as a raw binary file.

`printer_diag` is not included in ChromeOS. You can install it manually on the
device with test image from `cros_sdk`:

```
emerge-${BOARD} print_tools
cros deploy --board=${BOARD} ${IP} print_tools
```

Then, it may be run on the device from the console level:

```
printer_diag --url "ipp://example.org/printer" --version=2.0 --jsonf=out.json --binary=out.raw
```

In this example, the IPP Get-Printer-Attributes request is sent to the given
URL. The version of IPP protocol is set to 2.0 (default is 1.1). Obtained
response is dumped to a binary file out.raw (optional). The response is also
parsed and saved in JSON format to a file out.json (optional).

Run the program with `--help` parameter to get more details.
