# This file is parsed by chromeos::KeyValueStore. It has the format:
#
# <basename>=<shell command>\n
#
# Commands may be split across multiple lines using trailing backslashes.
#
# When an executable named <basename> crashes, the corresponding command is
# executed and its standard output and standard error are attached to the crash
# report.
#
# The contents of the log will be stripped for some potentially sensitive info
# (see CrashCollector::StripSensitiveData for a description of what gets
# stripped), but try to avoid collection of potential PII.
#
# Use caution in modifying this file. Only run common Unix commands here, as
# these commands will be run when a crash has recently occurred and we should
# avoid running anything that might cause another crash. Similarly, these
# commands block notification of the crash to parent processes, so commands
# should execute quickly.
