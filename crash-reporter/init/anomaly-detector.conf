# Let the daemon crash if it grows too much.  "as" is "address space" (vm
# size).  Since anomaly_detector maps in the journal files which are currently
# limited to 200MiB in size, we set the limit to three times that for safety.
# The VM size of the daemon when it's not mapping in journals is about 30MiB,
# so it fits well within this limit.

# /dev/log: We use syslog for error messages.
# /var/log: We monitor /var/log/messages for anomalies.  But we can't bind mount
#   that path directly because it gets rotated.
# /var/spool: We write out our crash reports here.
#   TODO: We should mount just /var/spool/crash.
# /var/lib/metrics: We write out uma stats directly.
# /sys: Some kernel detectors will read PCI device information.
# /run/crash_reporter: We need to indicate runtime state.
# /run/dbus: We need to talk to dbus.
# /run/metrics: crash_reporter needs to read metrics consent state.
# /home/chronos: crash_reporter running inside this minijail needs to read user
#   consent of error collection.
# /var/lib/devicesettings: crash_reporter needs to read device policy file.
# /run/daemon-store/crash: crash_reporter must write crashes to here.
# /run/daemon-store/uma-consent: crash_reporter must read per-user consent from
#   here.
# /run/daemon-store/appsync-optin: crash_reporter must read per-profile optin
#   from here.
#  Shorten this for line-length purposes. (Without the environment variable,
#  the line is over 80 characters, resulting in a lint failure. A line break
#  would insert undesired spaces into the middle of the argument.)
