// Storage allows for multiple generations for a given priority (if
// multi-genetation mode is enabled for this priority via finch flag).

// In multi-generation mode each queue is uniquely identifiable by a generation
// globally unique ID (guid) + priority tuple The generation guid is a randomly
// generation string. Generation guids have a one-to-one relationship with <DM
// token, Priority> tuples.

// Queues are created lazily with given priority when Write is called with a
// DM token we haven't seen before, as opposed to creating all queues during
// storage creation.

// Multi-generation queue directory names now have the format of
// <priority>.<generation GUID>, as oppsed to legacy queues named just
// <priority>

// Storage only creates queues on startup if it finds non-empty queue
// subdirectories in the storage directory. But these queues do not enqueue
// new records. They send their records and stay empty until they are deleted
// on the next restart of Storage.

// Empty subdirectories in the storage directory are deleted on storage
// creation. TODO(b/278620137): should also delete empty directories every 1-2
// days.

// In single-generation mode (legacy mode) there is only one queue per priority.
// Queues are created at the first start of the Storage and never erased.
