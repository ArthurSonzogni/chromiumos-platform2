debugd: system debug daemon

This daemon exposes system debugging information over DBus. Some of this
information requires privileges (root, access to particular DBus APIs, etc) to
get at. The goal of this exercise is to allow restriction of user-facing debug
tools so that they can just talk to this daemon over dbus and nothing else.
