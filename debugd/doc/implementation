Implementation: debugd

The debug daemon uses the DBus C API (documented at
<http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/index.html>) directly despite being
written in C++. This is mostly to reduce attack surface and complexity, but also
because of the simplicity of our use case: we have a single object that exposes
a single interface with only synchronous methods. Methods are bound in a table
of (name, function) pairs; new methods are added by adding entries to this
table.

A tool is a set of closely related API functions that diagnoses one thing (for
example, ICMP connectivity). The debug daemon invokes the corresponding tool for
each of its API functions. Dividing the DBus interface from the implementations
of each tool keeps the DebugDaemon class from growing too large and makes it
easier to test the individual tools.
