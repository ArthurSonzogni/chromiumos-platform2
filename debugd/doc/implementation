Implementation: debugd

The debug daemon uses the DBus C API (documented at
<http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/index.html>) directly despite being
written in C++. This is mostly to reduce attack surface and complexity, but also
because of the simplicity of our use case: we have a single object that exposes
a single interface with only synchronous methods. Methods are bound in a table
of (name, function) pairs; new methods are added by adding entries to this
table.

(The implementation docs will go here once there's more of an implementation.)
