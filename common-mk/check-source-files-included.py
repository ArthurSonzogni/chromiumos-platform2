"""Ensure source files are not missed and included in a gn file.

Occasionally, a source file, especially a unit test file, is added to the repo
but is not included in the build. This kind of mistake can often evade code
review, or is discovered only later in the review stage and wasted time for
early discovery of errors. This script examines each source file and checks
whether they are present in a *.gn file in their project directory.

Additionally, when a build file is changed, occasionally some source files
(especially test files) are left unbuilt. This script also checks for source
files that are not included anywhere when a build file is modified.
