# Chrome OS Screen Brightness Behavior

[TOC]

This document describes how `powerd` manages the display's backlight brightness.
For the vast majority of devices this is the internal display of the device, but
for a small set of devices (e.g., Chromeboxes) this may be an external display.

## Brightness calculations

`powerd` internally deals with two types of brightness values:

*   A user-visible *brightness percentage*, represented as a value between 0%
    and 100%.

*   A hardware-specific *brightness level*, used by the drivers and kernel.

The two values do not have a linear relationship. Instead, given a
hardware-specific minimum-visible level and maximum level, the mapping from a
user-visible percentage `percent` to the hardware level `level` is calculated as
follows:

```
fraction = (percent - 6.25) / (100 - 6.25)
linear_level = fractionÂ²
level = min_visible_level + linear_level * (max_level - min_visible_level)
```

See `policy::InternalBacklightController::PercentToLevel()` for the full
implementation.

In this document, we refer to the hardware level as a *hardware level*,
and the brightness *non-linear brightness percent*. The intermediate
calculation *linear level* is also discussed: this roughly corresponds
to the fraction of the display is driven at, where zero is "minimum
visible level" and one is "full brightness".

## Automatic brightness changes

If the device has one or more ambient light sensors, and when the sensor-based
automatic brightness is turned on, powerd will automatically choose a backlight
brightness based on the current power source (AC / battery), and the level of
ambient light (direct sunlight / something dimmer than that). When the one of
these changes, powerd will transition to a new brightness level.

The automatically-chosen non-linear brightness percentages are as follows:

| Power source | Direct sunlight (>= 400 lux) | Normal ambient light |
|--------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| AC           | 100% (100% linear)           | 80% (~62% linear)    |
| Battery      | 80% (~62% linear)            | 63% (~37% linear)    |

Devices that lack ambient light sensors just use the "normal ambient light"
levels listed above. Note that these levels may be set differently for different
devices.

In the past, powerd made continuous adjustments to the screen brightness based
on the ambient light level. This was distracting to users and also generally
ineffective: the majority of indoor environments occupy the bottom end of the
range reported by our ambient light sensors. Due to the coarse readings within
this range, the automatically-chosen brightness levels were frequently
undesirable. We decided to switch to just two levels: one that would work well
in most indoor environments, and a very-bright level for outdoor environments.

### Improved automatic brightness on some devices

Some devices, such as the Pixelbook, are equipped with a better ambient light
sensor. Such devices have a more finely-tuned configuration consisting of
seven levels as follows:

|Situation          |Lux Step Down|Lux Step Up|Brightness UI|Brightness Linear|
|-------------------|------------:|----------:|------------:|----------------:|
|Low light          |   *N/A*     |      90   |   36.14%    |      10.75%     |
|Indoor - normal    |      40     |     250   |   47.62%    |      20.00%     |
|Indoor - bright    |     180     |     360   |   60.57%    |      34.00%     |
|Outdoor - dark     |     250     |     500   |   71.65%    |      49.00%     |
|Outdoor - overcast |     350     |    1700   |   85.83%    |      72.24%     |
|Outdoor - clear sky|    1100     |    7000   |   93.27%    |      86.25%     |
|Direct sunlight    |    5000     |   *N/A*   |  100.00%    |     100.00%     |

Additionally, simple exponential smoothing is applied to the raw values read
from the ambient light sensor. This acts as a low-pass filter to remove noise
from the data, to avoid adjusting the brightness too frequently in some
lighting conditions such as an overhead source of warm white LED lighting.
[issue 826968]

In M88, a small number of devices were moved to an ML-based brightness control
logic. This logic is not hosted in powerd directly; rather, the [logic is in
Ash][ml-backlight], which calculates a desired backlight level and
communicates the result to powerd via a D-Bus API.

## Brightness and Ambient Light Sensor Behavior

As of M132, display brightness and Ambient Light Sensor (ALS) settings are now
remembered in Chrome and restored after a reboot.

### Boot time brightness selection

At boot, the panel backlight's brightness is set to 40% (computed linearly) of
its maximum level by the `boot-splash` Upstart job. This happens before the boot
splash animation is displayed by frecon.

### Out of Box Experience (OOBE)

The first time that the device boots, it should have no remembered setting to
restore from Chrome. Hence, after powerd starts, it chooses an initial backlight
brightness based on the power source (either AC or battery) and the ambient
light level, as described in the "Automatic brightness changes" section.

### During reboot

During reboot, the device restores previous brightness settings. The settings
are saved per user profile and are restored when the profile is loaded.

-   **Devices with ALS:**

    -   *ALS last on*: Brightness adjusts automatically; the previous brightness
        level is not restored.

    -   *ALS last off*: The system restores the last user-set brightness level.

-   **Devices without ALS:**

    -   Brightness always restores to the last user-set brightness level after a
        reboot.

### Brightness Control After Boot

#### Brightness control

Users can manually change the screen brightness in three ways:

*   **Brightness keys:** Use the brightness keys on keyboard, there are 16
    user-selectable brightness steps, divided evenly between the full non-linear
    percentage-based range (i.e. each button press moves the brightness by 100 /
    16 = 6.25%).

*   **Quick Settings:** Use the brightness slider in the Quick Settings panel.

*   **Settings app:** Use the brightness slider in the Display settings.

The draggable slider can be used to select a brightness percentage that doesn't
match one of the pre-defined steps.

#### Ambient light sensor control

User can toggle on/off Ambient Light Sensor (ALS) in the Display settings.
Meanwhile, manually adjusting the display brightness will temporarily disable
ALS.

#### Ambient light sensor re-enabled

Adjusting the display backlight brightness by brightness keys or Quick settings
temporarily disables the ALS. The ALS is automatically re-enabled after reboot
to prevent accidental deactivation.

The ALS state is saved if and only if the user explicitly disables the ALS in
the Settings app or adjust brightness percentage using Display settings slider.
Remembered settings are restored when the user profile loads after a reboot.

## Screen dimming and power off

When the user is inactive for an extended period of time, the screen is dimmed
to 10% of its maximum level (computed linearly) and then turned off. The screen
is turned back on in response to user activity (which is interpreted broadly:
keyboard or touchpad activity, power source change, external display being
connected or disconnected, etc.).

Users may reduce the backlight brightness to 0% using the brightness-down (F6)
key; this may be desirable to conserve battery power while streaming music. The
backlight is automatically increased to a low-but-visible level when user input
is observed after the brightness has been manually set to 0%.

## External monitor brightness

As of M35, Chromeboxes' brightness keys (or F6 and F7 keys) attempt to use
[DDC/CI] to increase or decrease external displays' brightness ([issue 315371]).
