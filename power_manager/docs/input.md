# Chrome OS Power Manager Input

powerd uses user input to determine when the system should turn its backlight
off or suspend in response to inactivity. powerd does not listen for this input
directly; rather, it receives periodic `HandleUserActivity` D-Bus method calls
from Chrome while the user is active. These method calls include a
[UserActivityType] enum describing the type of activity that was observed,
allowing powerd to e.g. avoid turning the screen back on if the user presses the
Brightness Down key while the screen is already off.

`powerd/system/input.cc` uses the kernel's input subsystem to observe power
button and lid switch events. (ACPI power button events may be additionally
received by Chrome as standard keyboard input, but they are ignored there since
button releases are not reported correctly.) These events are reported to Chrome
via `InputEvent` D-Bus signals containing [InputEvent] protocol buffers; Chrome
uses the power button notifications to display screen-lock and shutdown
animations.

See the [Power Buttons] document for more information about power button
behavior.
