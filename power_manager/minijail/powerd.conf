# Grant the following capabilities to powerd:
# CAP_WAKE_ALARM - Required by powerd to set wake up alarms for the instance.
#
# The -B 0x3 flag instructs Minijail to skip setting and locking the
# SECURE_NOROOT securebit. This allows powerd_setuid_helper, which is forked and
# exec'ed from powerd, to run as (root:power) with all effective capabilities
# after it calls setuid(2).
