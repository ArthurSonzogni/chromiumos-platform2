On Chrome OS, we want to dim the screen when the user is idle. To do this,
the power manager subscribes for idle notifications from XSync, and adjusts
the backlight based on whether or not the user is idle.

Executable programs:
  * backlight-tool (backlight-tool.cc)
    Simple tool to get and set the brightness level of the display backlight.
  * powerd (powerd.cc)
    Main power manager. Adjusts device status based on whether the
    user is idle. Currently, this daemon just adjusts the backlight,
    but in future it will handle other tasks such as turning off
    the screen and suspending to RAM.
  * xidle-example (xidle-example.cc)
    Prints console notifications when the user is and is not idle.

Main Classes:
  * Backlight (backlight.{cc,h})
    Get and set the brightness level of the display backlight.
  * IdleDimmer (idle_dimmer.{cc,h})
    Adjusts the backlight based on whether the user is idle.
  * XIdle (xidle.{cc,h})
    Receive notifications from the X Server when the user is marked as
    idle, or as no longer idle

Unit tests:
  * idle_dimmer_unittest.cc:
    Tests the IdleDimmer class.
  * xidle_unittest.cc:
    Tests the XIdle class with a real X server (or a virtual framebuffer).

Autotests:
  * hardware_Backlight
    Verifies that backlight-tool can adjust brightness.
  * power_Backlight
    Verifies that adjusting the brightness with the backlight-tool changes the
    amount of power used by the machine.
