On Chrome OS, we want to dim the screen when the user is idle. To do this,
the power manager subscribes for idle notifications from XSync, and adjusts
the backlight based on whether or not the user is idle.

Executable programs:
  * backlight-tool (backlight-tool.cc)
    Simple tool to get and set the brightness level of the display backlight.
  * powerd (powerd.cc)
    Main power manager. Adjusts device status based on whether the
    user is idle and on video activity indicator from the window manager.
    This daemon is responsible for dimming of the backlight, turning
    the screen off, and suspending to RAM. The daemon also has the
    capability of shutting the system down.
  * xidle-example (xidle-example.cc)
    Prints console notifications when the user is and is not idle.

Main Classes:
  * Backlight (backlight.{cc,h})
    Get and set the brightness level of the display backlight.
  * BacklightController (backlight_controller.{cc,h})
    Adjusts the backlight based on whether the user is idle.
  * VideoDetector (video_detector.{cc,h})
    Polls the root window for video activity timestamp posted by the window
    manager. Allows powerd to defer idle when video has been playing recently.
  * XIdle (xidle.{cc,h})
    Receive notifications from the X Server when the user is marked as
    idle, or as no longer idle

Unit tests:
  * idle_dimmer_unittest.cc:
    Tests the BacklightController class.
  * xidle_unittest.cc:
    Tests the XIdle class with a real X server (or a virtual framebuffer).

Autotests:
  * hardware_Backlight
    Verifies that backlight-tool can adjust brightness.
  * power_Backlight
    Verifies that adjusting the brightness with the backlight-tool changes the
    amount of power used by the machine.
