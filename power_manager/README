The power manager makes power-related policy decisions via C++ code running
in userspace. This repository contains the following directories:

  common:         Code shared between powerd and tools.
  default_prefs:  Default pref files installed to /usr/share/power_manager.
  dbus:           D-Bus policy configuration files.
  init:           Upstart config files installed to /usr/init.
  optional_prefs: Pref files conditionally installed based on USE flags.
  powerd:         Power manager daemon running as the "power" user.
  powerd/policy:  High-level parts of powerd that make policy decisions.
  powerd/system:  Low-level parts of powerd that communicate with the kernel.
  tools:          Utility programs; may depend on powerd code.
  udev:           udev configuration files and scripts.
