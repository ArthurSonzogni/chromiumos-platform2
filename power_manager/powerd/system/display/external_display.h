// Class for controlling an external display via DDC/CI.
//
// A brief summary:
//
// DDC/CI is a protocol enabling the host system to read and write various
// properties exposed by an external display over the I2C bus. This class is
// specifically interested in the display's brightness (a.k.a. luminance)
// property.
//
// DDC/CI allows the current and maximum brightness to be read by sending a
// request to the display, waiting for at least 40 milliseconds, and then
// reading the reply. It allows the brightness to be modified by sending a
// request to the display and then waiting at least 50 milliseconds before
// sending any following requests.
//
// This class caches the current brightness for a brief period of time after
// reading it from or writing it to the display; subsequent
// AdjustBrightnessByPercent() calls use that cached brightness as a starting
// point when computing new brightness levels. If an adjustment is requested
// after the cached brightness expires, the brightness is read before the update
// level is written. Multiple adjustments are coalesced when possible.
//
// This class is implemented as a simple state machine. The UpdateState() method
// is responsible for transitioning between states.
