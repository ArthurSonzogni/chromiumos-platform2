// charging will finish).
//
// These values will be used as inputs to the ML model for
// predicting when the charger is unplugged.
// These values are stored in /var/lib/power_manager/. For
// privacy reasons, we floor each time value to a multiple of 15 minutes. Data
// is retained for 30 days.
//
// Example of charge event:
// /var/lib/power_manager/charge_history/charge_events/13296083600000000:
//   "1800000000"
//
// This is a charge event with a 30 minute duration (value stored in
// microseconds). Since we floor all of the timestamps, if the charger is
// connected for less than 15 minutes, it will result in a 0 duration charge
// event. This means that charge events can collide (old event will be
// overwritten).
// The files in /var/lib/power_manager/time_on_ac/ and
// /var/lib/power_manager/time_full_on_ac/ have the same format. These files
// track the total duration for an individual day. The filename is the start of
// the day in microseconds since epoch (UTC). If a charge event spans more than
// 1 day, the duration will be distributed across the corresponding files for
// each day. For example, if 2 hours of charging are equally split across two
// days, with no other charging during those days, the following files will be
// created:
// /var/lib/power_manager/time_on_ac/<day 1>: <1 hour in microseconds>
// /var/lib/power_manager/time_on_ac/<day 2>: <1 hour in microseconds>
//
// If the battery reached full charge after 30 minutes, the following files will
// also be created:
// /var/lib/power_manager/time_full_on_ac/<day 1>: <30 minutes in microseconds>
// /var/lib/power_manager/time_full_on_ac/<day 2>: <1 hour in microseconds>
//
// These files are written when the charger is unplugged. .../time_full_on_ac/
// files are also written when entering a low power state, since those files
