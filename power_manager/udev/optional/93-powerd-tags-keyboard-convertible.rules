# Use this rule when the device
#  1) has an internal keyboard and,
#  2) is convertible and,
#  3) the power, volume up, and volume down go through the internal keyboard and
#     should also be inhibited when the device is in tablet mode (this is not
#     what you want when the volume buttons are side buttons).
#
# If the device has volume buttons that should still work in tablet mode, then
# the 93-powerd-tags-keyboard-side-buttons.rules is a better fit.
