# Diagnostic Routines

This guide details each of the diagnostic routines provided by cros_healthd,
along with any options the routine supports, a sample invocation run via the
diag component of cros-health-tool, and sample output from running the routine.
Routines can be run through crosh or directly through cros-health-tool. The
sample invocations below run the same routine for crosh and cros-health-tool.

[TOC]

## Routine Availability

Not all routines are available on all devices. For example, battery-related
routines are not available on Chromeboxes, which do not have batteries. To get a
list of all routines available on a given device, run the following command:

From crosh:
```bash
crosh> diag list
```

From cros-health-tool:
```bash
$ cros-health-tool diag get_routines
```

Sample output:
```bash
Available routine: battery_capacity
Available routine: battery_health
...
Available routine: floating_point_accuracy
Available routine: prime_search
```

## CLI(cros-health-tool) help message

Users can use `cros-health-tool diag $routine --help` to understand more about a
specific routine's parameters. Users can also use `cros-health-tool diag
get_routines` to get all routines, though some of them may not be supported.

```bash
$ cros-health-tool diag --help
cros-health-tool diag
    subtools: $routine, get_routines
    Usage: cros-health-tool diag $routine
    Usage: cros-health-tool diag $routine --help
    Usage: cros-health-tool diag get_routines
$routine: [ac_power, arc_dns_resolution, ...]
```

## Routine Configuration

Some routines use configuration data read from cros_config instead of exposing
parameters in the Mojo API. Configuration data is device-specific. If a board
runs a configurable routine whose configuration data is not set in cros_config,
the routine will fall back to fleet-wide defaults. Configuration data will be
listed in the description of routines which support it. In all cases, the data
should be set the cros_config path cros-healthd/routines/specific-routine. For a
concrete example, the battery health configuration data would look like the
following:

```yaml
some-config: &some_config
  <<: *base_config
  cros-healthd:
    routines:
      battery-health:
        maximum-cycle-count: "5"
        percent-battery-wear-allowed: "15"
```

## Routine Response
The routine response consists of:
- `Output`: (optional) Routine output.
- `Status`: Routine status.
- `Status message`: More information regarding current status. Error messages
are also included in this field.

*** note
**Warning**: Error messages listed here for each routine are only for reference
and subject to change from time to time without notice.

## Battery and Power Routines

### AC Power

Confirms that the AC power adapter is being recognized properly by the system.

Parameters:
-   `--ac_power_is_connected` - Whether or not a power supply is expected to be
    connected. Type: `bool`. Default: `true`.
-   `--expected_power_type` - The type of power supply expected to be connected.
    Only valid when `--ac_power_is_connected=true`. Type: `string`. Default:
    `""`

To ensure that a power supply of type USB_PD is connected and recognized:

From crosh:
```bash
crosh> diag ac_power --expected_power_type="USB_PD"
```

From cros-health-tool:
```bash
$ cros-health-tool diag ac_power --expected_power_type="USB_PD"
```

Sample output:
```bash
Progress: 33
Plug in the AC adapter.
Press ENTER to continue.

Progress: 100
Status: Passed
Status message: AC Power routine passed.
```

Errors:
- `Expected online power supply, found offline power supply.`
- `Expected offline power supply, found online power supply.`
- `Read power type different from expected power type.`
- `No valid AC power supply found.`
- `AC Power routine cancelled.`

### Battery Capacity

Confirms that the device's battery design capacity lies within the configured
limits.

Configuration Data::
-   `low-mah` - Lower bound for the allowable design capacity of the battery, in
    mAh. Type: `uint32_t`. Default: `1000`.
-   `high-mah` - Upper bound for the allowable design capacity of the battery,
    in mAh. Type: `uint32_t`. Default: `10000`.

To check the device's battery capacity:

From crosh:
```bash
crosh> diag battery_capacity
```

From cros-health-tool:
```bash
$ cros-health-tool diag battery_capacity
```

Sample output:
```bash
Progress: 100
Status: Passed
Status message: Battery design capacity within given limits.
```

Errors:
- `Invalid BatteryCapacityRoutineParameters.`
- `Battery design capacity within given limits.`
- `Battery design capacity not within given limits.`

### Battery Charge

Checks to see if the battery charges appropriately during a period of time.

Parameters:
-   `--length_seconds` - Length of time to run the routine for, in seconds.
    Type: `uint32_t`. Default: `10`.
-   `--minimum_charge_percent_required` - Minimum charge percent required during
    the runtime of the routine. If, after the routine ends, the battery has
    charged less than this percent, then the routine fails. Type: `uint32_t`.
    Default: `0`.

The battery charge routine will return an error if the sum of
`--minimum_charge_percent_required` and the charge percentage of the device's
battery when the routine is started is greater than 100%. For example, if the
device's battery is at 90% and the following command was run from crosh:
```bash
crosh> diag battery_charge --minimum_charge_percent_required=20
```

Then the output would be:
```bash
Progress: 0
Unplug the AC adapter.
Press ENTER to continue.

Progress: 0
Output: {
    "errorDetails": {
        "chargePercentRequested": 20,
        "startingBatteryChargePercent": 90
    }
}

Status: Error
Status message: Invalid minimum required charge percent requested.
```

Assuming the device's battery is less than 91%, then to ensure the battery
charges at least than 10 percent in 600 seconds:

From crosh:
```bash
crosh> diag battery_charge --length_seconds=600 --minimum_charge_percent_required=10
```

From cros-health-tool:
```bash
$ cros-health-tool diag battery_charge --length_seconds=600 --minimum_charge_percent_required=10
```

Sample output, if the battery were to charge 12.123456789012345% during the routine:
```bash
Progress: 0
Unplug the AC adapter.
Press ENTER to continue.

Progress: 100
Output: {
    "resultDetails": {
        "chargePercent": 12.123456789012345
    }
}

Status: Passed
Status message: Battery charge routine passed.

To ensure the battery discharges less than 10 percent in 600 seconds:

From crosh:
```bash
crosh> diag battery_discharge --length_seconds=600 --maximum_discharge_percent_allowed=10
```

From cros-health-tool:
```bash
$ cros-health-tool diag battery_discharge --length_seconds=600 --maximum_discharge_percent_allowed=10
```

```bash
Progress: 0
Unplug the AC adapter.
Press ENTER to continue.

Progress: 100
Progress: 100
Output: {
    "resultDetails": {
        "dischargePercent": 1.123456789012345
    }
}
