# Telemetry

On-device telemetry API serves the clients on both Chromium and
platform. The [data sources listed table](#TODO) could be
scattered around different services and it is our vision to hide those tedious
details away from our clients. In addition, single source will help the data
utilization easier to process on the server side if it is our client's final
destination.

We also support a [proactive event subscription](#TODO) API make clients could
subscript the particular event and got real-time notified when the event
occurs.

If you can't find the things you want, [contact us][team-contact] for a quick
check on the latest status just in case the documentation is behind the
reality.
