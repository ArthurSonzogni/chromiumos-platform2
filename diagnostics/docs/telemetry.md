# Telemetry

On-device telemetry API serves the clients on both Chromium and
platform. The [data sources listed table](#Telemetry-categories) could be
scattered around different services and it is our vision to hide those tedious
details away from our clients. In addition, single source will help the data
utilization easier to process on the server side if it is our client's final
destination.

We also support a [proactive event subscription](#Events) API make clients could
subscript the particular event and got real-time notified when the event
occurs.

If you can't find the things you want, [contact us][team-contact] for a quick
check on the latest status just in case the documentation is behind the
reality.

## Usages

### Mojo interface

- `CrosHealthdProbeService` interface
    - `ProbeTelemetryInfo(categories)` can grab the data from selected
      `categories` from a single IPC call.
    - `ProbeProcessInfo(process_id)` can retrieve the
      [process information](#ProcessInfo) for a specific `process_id`.
    - `ProbeMultipleProcessInfo(process_ids, ignore_single_process_error)` can
      retrieve the [process information](#ProcessInfo) for the array of
      `process_ids` and errors if any occurred. Leave `process_ids` null can
      retrieve all current existing processes on the device; setting
      `ignore_single_process_error` to true will ignore any errors if occurred.
- `CrosHealthdEventService` interface
    - `AddEventObserver(category, observer)` for category(`EventCategoryEnum`)
      events.

See the Mojo interface comment for the detail.

Note that, __Strongly recommend__ to split your request into multiple and fetch
a subset of interesting categories in each call, and setup disconnect handler
to be able to return partial data. As `ProbeTelemetryInfo()` might not be
returned under certain critical situation. (e.g. `cros_healthd` got killed or
crash, a common cases is the seccomp vialation).

### CLI tool

`cros-health-tool` is a convenience tools **for testing**, it is not for production used.
We recommended to [reach us][team-contact] before using this in your project.

For telemetry, we can initiate a request via `cros-health-tool telem
--category=<xx>` where `<xx>` is the category name. The list of category names
could be checked via `cros-health-tool telem --help`.

For process, we can initiate a request via `cros-health-tool telem
--process=<process_id>,<process_id>,<process_id>` to retrieve single or multiple
process information or `cros-health-tool telem --process=all` to retrieve all
current existing processes. Adding `--ignore` can ignore single process errors.

For event, `cros-health-tool event --category=<xx>` where `<xx>` is the event
category name. The list of category names could be checked via `cros-health-tool
event --help`.
